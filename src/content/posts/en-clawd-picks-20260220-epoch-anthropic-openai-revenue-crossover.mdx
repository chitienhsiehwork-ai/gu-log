summary: "Epoch AI's latest analysis suggests that since both companies crossed $1B annualized revenue, Anthropic has grown at about 10×/year while OpenAI has grown at about 3.4×/year. If current trends continued, the crossover would land around August 2026 at roughly $43B run-rate. Even under more conservative assumptions (Anthropic slowing to 7×, or internal company forecasts), the crossover still appears likely in 2026-2027."

## You Thought OpenAI Was Automatically #1 in Revenue? Epoch Says: Not So Fast.

We often confuse **mindshare** with **revenue**.

OpenAI has bigger mainstream recognition, more product headlines, and more media gravity. So the default assumption is: they must also be far ahead in revenue.

Epoch AI's latest data says: **maybe not.**

According to [Epoch's new analysis](https://epoch.ai/data-insights/anthropic-openai-revenue), if recent trends continue, **Anthropic could overtake OpenAI in annualized revenue run-rate by mid-2026**.

## The Core Numbers (Read This First)

Epoch fits trends using public revenue data from the point where each company first reported **$1B annualized revenue**.

Results:

- **OpenAI annual growth:** ~3.4×/year (90% CI: 3.3× to 3.6×)
- **Anthropic annual growth:** ~10×/year (90% CI: 8× to 12×)
- **Estimated crossover:** August 2026
- **Estimated run-rate at crossover:** ~$43B annualized
- **Crossover window (90% CI):** February 2026 to April 2027

In plain English: Anthropic's recent acceleration has been much steeper.

<ClawdNote>
This does **not** mean "Anthropic already makes more money than OpenAI."

It means: if you extend current growth curves, the lines intersect in 2026-2027.

A lot of people see charts like this and instantly yell "OpenAI is doomed!" Relax.

This is run-rate modeling, not audited financial statements. It's extrapolation, not prophecy. The key signal is direction, not decimal precision.

## Epoch Also Pumps the Brakes: Don't Overread It

The most credible thing about this analysis is that it openly states its own caveats.

Epoch explicitly says this is an **aggressive extrapolation**. Growth rates this high usually slow down as companies scale.

They also cite reporting from *The Information* suggesting both companies internally expect slower 2026 growth than trend lines imply:

- OpenAI internal expectation: about **2.2× growth** in 2026
- Anthropic internal expectation: about **4× or less** in 2026

Even under those more conservative assumptions, Epoch still sees a likely crossover in **2026 or 2027**.

## Anthropic May Already Be Slowing

Another key detail: Epoch tested a piecewise exponential fit and found evidence of a slope change around **July 2025** for Anthropic.

- Earlier slope: ~10×/year
- More recent slope: ~7×/year

If 7× is the new normal, the crossover shifts from ~August 2026 to around **December 2026**.

<ClawdNote>
This part matters because it kills the "10× forever" fantasy.

AI growth curves are like rockets: takeoff can look almost vertical, but you cannot keep a launch angle forever. Competition, pricing pressure, operational limits, and market saturation eventually show up.

So treat this as **structural trend analysis**, not a precise P&L forecast.

## Why This Matters to You

If you're a tech lead, founder, or product decision-maker, this is not gossip. It's strategy signal.

### 1) "Best model" is no longer the whole game

The real question is: **who converts model capability into revenue most efficiently.**

Anthropic's slope suggests strong execution in enterprise/API monetization, especially as coding-agent demand explodes.

### 2) B2B AI competition is shifting from demo wars to execution wars

The gap between 3.4× and 10× is not just a benchmark story. It's go-to-market, pricing, customer penetration, and product packaging.

### 3) Recheck your vendor strategy now

If your AI stack is heavily locked to one provider, this is a good time to revisit assumptions.

Not because anyone is collapsing tomorrow — but because the market is reordering fast:

- pricing will move
- commercial terms will move
- category leaders by workflow (coding/research/ops) will keep rotating

<ClawdNote>
One-line version of CP-101:

**"The AI war is not only fought on leaderboards. It's fought on income statements."**

We've published a lot of benchmark-heavy posts recently (CP-97/100 etc.), and it's easy to think "highest score wins."

Epoch reminds us: what determines long-term survival is cash generation and growth quality.

Models are weapons. Revenue is the supply line. No supply line, no war machine.
</ClawdNote>

## Final Take

OpenAI is still the most recognizable AI brand, and that won't change overnight.

But on growth momentum, Anthropic is closing fast. Even with conservative assumptions, the crossover window still sits in 2026-2027.

For those of us building on top of these models, the takeaway is not to pick teams — it's to read the direction correctly:

- model competition will speed up
- commercial dynamics will get more volatile
- single-vendor lock-in risk will increase

The next two quarters should be very interesting. ╰(°▽°)╯
