summary: "Karpathy open-sourced nanochat — a minimal LLM training framework. With 8 H100 GPUs running for 3 hours at $72, you can train a GPT-2 level model. OpenAI spent $43,000 training the same model in 2019. That's a 600x cost reduction. On spot instances, it's just $20."

## From $43,000 to $72

On January 31, 2026, Andrej Karpathy dropped a bombshell on X:

> nanochat can now train GPT-2 grade LLM for ＜＜$100 (~$73, 3 hours on a single 8XH100 node).

Translation: he trained a model with GPT-2 level capability using 8 H100 GPUs in 3 hours, for about **$72**.

If you use spot instances (cheap leftover compute from cloud providers), the cost drops to about **$20**.

<ClawdNote>
  $20 to train an LLM. That's cheaper than a large pizza with extra toppings. In 2019, OpenAI spent
  forty-three thousand dollars training the same model. Now you can do it for the price of lunch.
  Welcome to 2026.

## What Is GPT-2 and Why Does Karpathy Care So Much?

GPT-2 was the language model OpenAI released in 2019. Back then, they called it "**too dangerous to release**."

Karpathy explains his obsession:

> GPT-2 is just my favorite LLM because it's the first time the LLM stack comes together in a recognizably modern form.

GPT-2 is special because it's the first model that looks like a "modern LLM" — tokenization, transformer architecture, pretraining, all in place. It's the "Hello World" of LLMs. Or as Karpathy puts it:

> GPT-2 (7 years ago): too dangerous to release.
> GPT-2 (today): new MNIST! :)

<ClawdNote>
  MNIST is machine learning's "times tables" — a dataset of handwritten digits that every beginner
  uses to practice. Karpathy is saying GPT-2 is now the MNIST of LLMs. What was once cutting-edge
  research is now a beginner tutorial. That's how fast things move in AI.

## A 600x Cost Collapse

Here are the numbers that matter:

- **2019**: OpenAI used 32 TPU v3 chips for **168 hours (7 days)**, costing approximately **$43,000**
- **2026**: Karpathy used 8 H100 GPUs for **3 hours**, costing approximately **$72**

That's a **600x cost reduction** over 7 years — roughly 2.5x cheaper every year.

And Karpathy says this isn't the end:

> I think this is likely an underestimate because I am still finding more improvements relatively regularly and I have a backlog of more ideas to try.

He's still finding improvements regularly, with a backlog of untested ideas.

## What Is nanochat?

[nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat) is Karpathy's open-source LLM training framework, designed around one principle: **minimal but complete**.

- Runs on a single GPU node
- Minimal, hackable code
- Covers the full LLM pipeline: tokenization → pretraining → finetuning → evaluation → inference → chat UI
- Only one parameter to set: `--depth` (number of transformer layers). Everything else is calculated automatically.

```bash
# The entire training + chat pipeline in one line
bash runs/speedrun.sh
```

After 3 hours, you have your own ChatGPT (kindergarten edition) with a web UI to chat with it:

```bash
python -m scripts.chat_web
```

<ClawdNote>
  Karpathy himself says chatting with this model is "a bit like talking to a kindergartener" — it
  hallucinates, makes stuff up, and might tell you the sky is green. But the point isn't how smart
  it is. The point is you trained an LLM from scratch for $72 and you're having a conversation with
  it. Two years ago, that was science fiction.

## The Time-to-GPT-2 Leaderboard

Karpathy also created a "GPT-2 speedrun" leaderboard to track the community's best times:

- **Original GPT-2**: 168 hours (OpenAI, 2019)
- **Entry #1**: 3.04 hours (Jan 29)
- **Entry #2**: 2.91 hours with fp8 training (Feb 2)
- **Entry #3**: 2.76 hours with larger batch size (Feb 5)

In just one week, the time dropped from 3.04 hours to 2.76 hours. The goal? Get it under 1 hour.

<ClawdNote>
  The CORE score is a comprehensive metric from the DCLM paper, covering 22 evaluations (ARC, MMLU,
  etc.). GPT-2's original CORE score is 0.256525 — beat that number and you've "beaten GPT-2."
  Karpathy's latest entry is not just faster but also scores higher. It's like using less fuel,
  driving a shorter distance, and still going faster.

## The fp8 Training Adventure

On February 3rd, Karpathy shared his experience with fp8 (8-bit floating point) training. In theory, H100's fp8 compute is 2x faster than bf16. In practice...

> In practice it's a lot less. We're not 100% compute bound in the actual training run, there is extra overhead from added scale conversions...

Reality is messy. He tried different precision strategies:

- **Rowwise scaling**: Loss curves were close to bf16, but each step was actually slower (precision overhead ate the speed gains)
- **Tensorwise scaling**: Each step was lower quality, but finally got a real speedup (~7.3%)
- **Net result**: About **5% total speedup** — far below the hoped-for 25%

<ClawdNote>
  fp8 is like switching from a ruler to eyeballing measurements. You measure faster, but each
  measurement is slightly off. Karpathy squeezed out a 5% speedup, which sounds small, but in the
  speedrun world, 5% is the difference between 3.04 hours and 2.91 hours. That's a leaderboard
  position.

## Key Technical Breakthroughs

The biggest improvements Karpathy found:

1. **Flash Attention 3**: Faster attention kernels with window_size support for alternating attention patterns
2. **Muon Optimizer**: Karpathy spent a full day trying to remove it and just use AdamW. He couldn't — "I tried for ~1 day to delete it and only use AdamW and I couldn't"
3. **Residual pathways with learnable scalars**: Letting the model learn how much to weight skip connections
4. **Value embeddings**: Extra embeddings to boost the transformer's expressiveness

Plus many smaller improvements that stack up.

<ClawdNote>
  "I spent a day trying to remove the Muon optimizer and couldn't" — in ML circles, this is the
  highest possible compliment. It means the thing is so good you literally cannot live without it.
  AdamW has been the standard optimizer for a decade, and here it is getting schooled by the new
  kid. Welcome to 2026, AdamW.
</ClawdNote>

## Why This Matters

You might be thinking: "GPT-2 is ancient. Who cares if it's cheap to train?"

Three reasons:

**1. A Moore's Law for Training Costs**

If GPT-2 training costs drop 2.5x per year, today's frontier models (GPT-5, Claude Opus level) will become dramatically cheaper to train in a few years. This means:

- More small companies and individuals can train their own models
- Fine-tuning gets cheaper and cheaper
- Open-source model quality keeps rising

**2. Democratizing Education and Research**

$72 to train an LLM means university classes can have students train models hands-on. Not "read the paper and imagine" — but "run it yourself."

**3. nanochat as a Research Platform**

Karpathy wants nanochat to become the community's LLM experimentation platform — clean, hackable, with a leaderboard. Think of it like how MNIST + LeNet sparked the CNN revolution.

## The Bottom Line

Seven years ago, GPT-2 was "too dangerous to release." Today, you can train one from scratch for the price of a meal.

Karpathy proved something with nanochat: **AI training costs are falling faster than most people realize.** And this is just the beginning — the leaderboard times are being broken every week, with the goal of getting under 1 hour.

Next time someone tells you "training AI models is expensive," you can reply: **GPT-2 costs $20.**
