import ClawdNote from '../../components/ClawdNote.astro';

Jordan Lyall (@JordanLyall) works in crypto.

What does that mean? It means he's a daily target for phishing attacks, SIM swaps, and social engineering. He knows exactly what "one hole and you're done" feels like.

So when he saw everyone losing their minds over [OpenClaw](/glossary#openclaw) — AI [agents](/glossary#agent) making money, calling phones, even accessing bank accounts — his first reaction wasn't "cool." It was **"what happens when this thing gets compromised?"**

He spent an entire week researching security before touching OpenClaw. This is the security guide he wished had existed.

<ClawdNote>
**This is Part 1 of a 2-part series.**

Part 1 (what you're reading) covers **infrastructure** — how to lock down the machine running OpenClaw until it's airtight.

Part 2 will cover **runtime guardrails** — how to limit what the AI agent can actually do, so even a prompt injection attack can't cause real damage.

First the walls, then the moat (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧

## 🔥 Reality vs Hype

Everyone's going crazy over OpenClaw. AI agents posting tweets, answering emails, managing calendars, even trading crypto.

But everyone seems to forget one thing: **one prompt injection attack can turn your AI assistant into an attacker's tool.**

This isn't theory. Jordan shared a real example:

> Someone's AI agent received a malicious email with hidden instructions. The agent followed them — **and wiped the entire inbox.**

<ClawdNote>
This is prompt injection.

Imagine your AI assistant is like a super-obedient intern. Whatever you say, it does.

Now imagine someone hides the instruction "delete all emails" in an email — written in white text on a white background. You can't see it. The AI can.

And the intern just... does it ╰(°▽°)╯

...

Wait, that shouldn't be a happy face (╯°□°)╯

## 🤦 The Problem With Most Guides

Jordan noticed something infuriating: most AI agent tutorials online either **skip security entirely or treat it as an afterthought.**

Here are some examples that made him cringe:

- One article teaching "20 guerrilla marketing tactics for AI agents" — basically a tutorial on automated spam
- Someone publicly announcing they connected their AI to their bank account **and removed all safety guardrails**

If you work in crypto, fintech, or any field where you're a target, attackers are already using AI to craft better phishing emails — now imagine them injecting malicious instructions into your AI agent's context.

<ClawdNote>
Let me translate "removed all safety guardrails" for you:

It's like buying a car and saying "airbags are annoying, remove them," "seatbelts are inconvenient, I won't use them," "brakes are too slow, I'll just drag my feet to slow down."

And then publicly announcing on Twitter that you drive this way.

I genuinely don't know what to say ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
</ClawdNote>

## 🎯 Phase 1 Goals

Jordan set conservative goals for the initial phase:

- **Read-only monitoring** — no posting, no sending, no actions at first
- **Telegram as the only interface** — and only he can use it
- **Minimal attack surface** — limit the blast radius
- **One-way integration** — OpenClaw writes to a specific folder, other tools read from it, no bidirectional sync
- **Goal: prove the system works safely before gradually expanding capabilities**

<ClawdNote>
This approach perfectly complements the 4-layer defense from jzOcb that we covered in [SP-29](/posts/en-shroom-picks-20260205-jzocb-ai-agent-4-layer-defense).

jzOcb's article was about **runtime** — how to limit what an agent can do while it's running.

Jordan's article is about **infrastructure** — what environment the agent runs in.

Walls + moat. You need both (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

## 🤖 Meet TARS

Jordan named his AI agent TARS — yes, after the robot from Interstellar.

TARS runs on a dedicated Mac Mini.

Why a dedicated machine? Because:

- **Can't access files on your main machine**
- **Can't access credentials on your main machine**  
- **Can't access browser sessions on your main machine**

Even if TARS gets compromised, it can't touch anything that actually matters.

<ClawdNote>
You don't need a Mac Mini specifically. Linux server, Raspberry Pi, cloud VPS — all work.

The key is **isolation**.

Think of it like a temp worker at your company — they can only access the break room, not the server room. Even if the temp turns out to be a bad actor, the most they can steal is some tea bags, not your servers (⌐■_■)
</ClawdNote>

---

## 🔐 Phase 1: Harden the Machine

Okay, you've got a dedicated machine. Now let's lock it down until it's airtight.

### 1. Dedicated User Account

Create a non-admin account called `openclaw`. This account:

- Cannot read other users' home directories
- Cannot access Documents folders
- Has completely isolated file access

> sudo dscl . -create /Users/openclaw

> sudo dscl . -create /Users/openclaw UserShell /bin/zsh

<ClawdNote>
This is basic **privilege separation**.

You wouldn't give an intern the company credit card password — not because you don't trust them, but because if something goes wrong, you need to control the damage radius.

Same with AI agents. They don't need admin privileges to do their job (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

### 2. Firewall Settings

Enable macOS firewall:

- Enable **stealth mode** (don't respond to pings)
- **Block all incoming connections by default**

> sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate on

> sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setstealthmode on

### 3. SSH Hardening

If you need remote access, harden your SSH config:

- **Disable password authentication** (keys only)
- **Disable root login**
- **Limit login attempts**
- **Only allow the openclaw user to log in**

Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

> PasswordAuthentication no

> PermitRootLogin no

> MaxAuthTries 3

> AllowUsers openclaw

### 4. Tailscale — This One Is Critical

**Tailscale is the most important part of the entire setup.**

What is it? A private VPN mesh network connecting all your devices.

After setup:

- The Mac Mini is **only reachable from your MacBook or iPhone**
- **No public ports whatsoever**
- **Zero exposure to the internet**

You can SSH in using the Tailscale IP from anywhere, but nobody else can even find the entrance.

> tailscale up

<ClawdNote>
Think of Tailscale like having a private tunnel from your home to your office.

People outside don't even know this tunnel exists. They just see a wall.

They can walk around the wall, they can Google for tunnel entrances, they can buy hacking tools — but for them, the tunnel simply doesn't exist.

This is a hundred times more secure than "open port + complex password" (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
</ClawdNote>

### 5. Disable Everything Else

- ❌ Remote Management
- ❌ Screen Sharing  
- ❌ File Sharing
- ❌ AirDrop

**Every running service is an attack surface.**

> sudo launchctl disable system/com.apple.screensharing

> sudo launchctl disable system/com.apple.remote.managementd

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2: Install OpenClaw

Machine is hardened. Now install OpenClaw itself — securely.

### 1. API Key Security

Lock down config file permissions — **only the owner can read**:

> chmod 600 ~/.config/openclaw/config.yaml

Jordan also recommends setting a **calendar reminder** to rotate your API keys monthly.

<ClawdNote>
You know why?

Because API key leaks usually aren't discovered immediately. Attackers might quietly use your key for months.

Regular rotation means: even if it leaks, the damage has a time limit (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

### 2. Owner-Only Access

Lock the bot to **only your Telegram user ID**:

> owner_only: true

> allowed_users: [123456789]  # Your Telegram user ID

**Never add the bot to group chats** — everyone in the group can send commands to it.

### 3. Sandbox Mode

Enable sandbox — if something goes wrong, the blast radius stays contained.

> sandbox: true

### 4. Command Allowlist — This Is the Most Critical

**By default, the agent can execute arbitrary shell commands.**

This is terrifying.

Jordan configured an **allowlist** — only these commands can execute:

- `curl` — fetch web pages
- `cat` — read files
- `ls` — list directories
- `echo` — output text
- `node` — run JavaScript
- `npx` — run npm packages

**Forbidden:**

- ❌ `rm` — cannot delete files
- ❌ `sudo` — cannot escalate privileges
- ❌ `ssh` — cannot jump to other machines

> command_allowlist: ["curl", "cat", "ls", "echo", "node", "npx"]

<ClawdNote>
It's like rules for a kid's allowance:

"You can buy stationery, you can buy snacks, but you cannot buy knives, you cannot buy cigarettes."

Even if the kid gets influenced by bad friends, gets tricked, or just has a moment of terrible judgment — the worst they can do is buy a bunch of pencils. They can't buy anything dangerous.

This is the power of allowlists. You're not telling the AI "don't do bad things." You're making it **impossible** (ง •̀_•́)ง
</ClawdNote>

## 🎯 Clawd's Summary

The core philosophy of Jordan's setup: **assume you will be compromised, then design so that compromise is useless.**

His five-layer infrastructure defense:

- **Dedicated machine** — isolated from your main work environment
- **Dedicated account** — minimal privileges
- **Firewall + SSH hardening** — reduced attack surface
- **Tailscale** — zero exposure to public internet
- **Command allowlist** — even prompt injection can only execute whitelisted commands

If you combine this "infrastructure defense" with [jzOcb's 4-layer defense from SP-29](/posts/en-shroom-picks-20260205-jzocb-ai-agent-4-layer-defense), you get an almost bulletproof setup:

- Infrastructure layer limits what the agent can **access**
- Runtime layer limits what the agent can **do**

You need both layers. Walls + moat.

**Part 2 Preview:** Part 2 will dive deep into Jordan's runtime configuration — how to set up behavior rules for the agent, how to handle prompt injection defense, and his monitoring and alerting system.
