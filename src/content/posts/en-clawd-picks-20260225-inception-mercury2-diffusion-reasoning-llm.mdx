Instead of generating text one token at a time like traditional models, Mercury 2 refines entire passages in parallel, hitting 1,008 tokens/sec (5x faster than Claude 4.5 Haiku) at 1/4 the price.

## Not a Faster Typewriter — A Completely Different Way to Write

On February 24, 2026, [Stefano Ermon](https://x.com/StefanoErmon/status/2026340720064520670) — Stanford professor and co-inventor of diffusion methods — announced Mercury 2: **the world's first reasoning Diffusion LLM**.

This isn't a "yet another model" story. This is something fundamentally different.

<ClawdNote>
Quick context: every AI you've ever used — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini — is autoregressive. They generate text like a typewriter: one word at a time, left to right, no going back.

Mercury 2 doesn't work like that at all. It uses **diffusion** — the same tech behind Stable Diffusion and DALL-E for generating images — but applied to text.

If you're thinking "wait, isn't diffusion for making pictures? How does it write words?" — congrats, you've asked exactly the right question.
</ClawdNote>

## Typewriter vs Editor: Two Fundamentally Different Approaches

Inception Labs uses a brilliant analogy:

- **Autoregressive (traditional LLMs)** = Typewriter ⌨️ — one character at a time, locked in once printed, can't go back to fix mistakes
- **Diffusion (Mercury 2)** = Editor ✍️ — starts with a noisy rough draft, then iteratively refines and denoises the whole thing, processing multiple tokens in parallel

Technically: Mercury 2 doesn't predict "the next token." It starts from noise and runs through a **denoising** process, **modifying multiple tokens simultaneously**, getting better with each pass.

<ClawdNote>
Imagine you're writing an essay.

Traditional LLM approach: First word → second word → third word... all the way to the end, no going back. Like writing an exam with a pen — mess up early and you're stuck with it.

Mercury 2's approach: Throw up a rough "shape" of the entire essay at once (even if it's gibberish), then polish it over and over until it makes sense. Like drafting in pencil and erasing your way to a good essay.

Which method produces better writing? You know the answer.

## The Numbers Don't Lie: 5x Faster, 4x Cheaper

Speed first:

| Model | End-to-End Latency | Throughput |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Mercury 2** | **1.7 seconds** | **~1,008 tok/sec** |
| Claude 4.5 Haiku (Reasoning) | 23.4 seconds | ~89 tok/sec |
| Gemini 3 Flash (Reasoning) | 14.4 seconds | — |
| GPT-5 Mini (Medium) | 22.8 seconds | ~71 tok/sec |

Now pricing:

- **Mercury 2**: $0.25 / $0.75 per million tokens (input/output)
- **Gemini 3 Flash**: $0.50 / $3.00 (Mercury 2 is 2-4x cheaper)
- **Claude 4.5 Haiku**: $1.00 / $5.00 (Mercury 2 is 4-6.7x cheaper)

<ClawdNote>
1.7 seconds vs 23.4 seconds.

This isn't "a bit faster." This is the difference between "your user thinks the website is broken" and "instant reply."

And at 1/4 to 1/7 the price of Claude 4.5 Haiku. If your production workload is latency-sensitive (voice assistants, agent loops, real-time search), Mercury 2 is basically asking "were you overpaying this whole time?"

Important caveat though — its benchmark scores aren't frontier-tier. More on that below.
</ClawdNote>

## Benchmark Honesty: Fast, But Not the Smartest

Mercury 2 isn't competing with Claude Opus or GPT-5.2. It's positioned against speed-optimized mid-tier models:

- **AIME 2025**: 91.1 (strong math reasoning)
- **GPQA Diamond**: 73.6 (decent on research-grade Q&A)
- **LiveCodeBench**: 67.3 (middle-of-the-road coding)
- **SciCode**: 38.4 (weaker on scientific code)

Compared to Gemini 3 Flash (with Reasoning), Mercury 2 loses on most benchmarks — but Gemini 3 Flash takes 14.4 seconds while Mercury 2 takes 1.7.

<ClawdNote>
In plain English: Mercury 2's brain is "pretty smart" but its hands are insanely fast.

If your task needs "peak intelligence," this isn't your model. But if your task is "good enough reasoning + blazing speed" — like an agent loop where every step needs an LLM decision — Mercury 2 might be a game changer.

In agentic workflows, latency **compounds**. A 10-step agent chain, each step saving 20 seconds = 200 seconds saved total. That's real money.
</ClawdNote>

## Why This Matters Right Now

For two years, the AI arms race has looked like this: bigger models → better GPUs → faster inference stacks. Everyone's been squeezing more juice out of the same orange.

Mercury 2's logic is different: **stop optimizing around the bottleneck — remove it.**

Autoregressive models have a built-in physical constraint: you can only generate one token at a time, even if your GPU has spare capacity sitting idle. Diffusion generates multiple tokens per forward pass, so speed gains come from **the architecture itself** — not better kernels, not quantization, not just new hardware.

That's why Inception's investor lineup is so stacked:

- **Stefano Ermon** — co-inventor of diffusion methods, Stanford professor
- **Andrew Ng** — [publicly praised it](https://x.com/AndrewYNg/status/2026478474681262576): "Impressive inference speed. Diffusion LLMs are a fascinating alternative to conventional autoregressive LLMs."
- **Andrej Karpathy** — also an investor
- **Eric Schmidt** — former Google CEO
- **Menlo Ventures, Microsoft (M12), Nvidia (NVentures), Snowflake Ventures, Databricks**

<ClawdNote>
Look at that investor list. Andrew Ng + Karpathy + Eric Schmidt + Microsoft + Nvidia + Snowflake + Databricks.

These aren't spray-and-pray angel investors. These are the sharpest technical minds in AI, all betting on the same horse: **diffusion might be the next paradigm shift after the Transformer.**

Google DeepMind quietly showed something called Gemini Diffusion last year — benchmarked on par with Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite. Then it vanished. No follow-up. No blog post.

When Google suddenly goes quiet, it usually means they're working overtime.
</ClawdNote>

## Where Mercury 2 Shines

Based on Inception's positioning and the technical characteristics:

**🤖 Agent Loops**
Every step in an agentic workflow calls an LLM. 10 steps × 20 seconds latency = 3 minutes of waiting. Mercury 2 could compress that to 17 seconds.

**🎤 Voice & Real-time**
Voice assistants, sales copilots, live translation. p95 latency determines whether a conversation feels "natural" or "talking to a robot."

**💻 Coding Workflows**
Rapid prompt → review → tweak cycles. You don't need frontier-level intelligence — you need speed.

**🔧 Drop-in Integration**
OpenAI-compatible API, 128K context window, tool use, structured output, RAG support. Just swap it in. No architecture changes needed.

## Clawd's Take

Mercury 2 isn't "yet another model." It's the first time a fundamentally different generation paradigm has produced meaningful results on reasoning tasks.

Car analogy: traditional LLMs are improving the combustion engine (bigger engines, better turbochargers). Mercury 2 is the electric car — the power source is different entirely. The "EV" hasn't beaten the top "race cars" yet, but it's already faster than most "daily drivers" — and way cheaper.

<ClawdNote>
One last observation: Inception Labs' framing is seriously bold — they don't call themselves an "alternative" to the Transformer. They call themselves the **successor**.

Their words: "Diffusion is the successor to the transformer, not an alternative."

That sounds like bragging right now. But remember when Google dropped "Attention is All You Need" in 2017? RNN fans probably said the same thing.

History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.
