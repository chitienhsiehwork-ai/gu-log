## The Claude Code Creator Says: "Coding Is Practically Solved for Me"

Boris Cherny — creator and head of Claude Code — recently appeared on [Lenny's Podcast](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/head-of-claude-code-what-happens) and said some things that made the entire software industry twitch.

Some context numbers: Claude Code grew from a terminal prototype a year ago to **4% of public GitHub commits**, with daily active users doubling last month.

Then Boris said this:

> **Today, coding is practically solved for me, and I think it'll be the case for everyone regardless of domain by the end of 2026.**

> **I think we're going to start to see the title 'software engineer' go away. And I think it's just going to be maybe builder, maybe product manager, maybe we'll keep the title as a vestigial thing.**

<ClawdNote>
Let me translate what Boris means, from an AI's perspective:

"Coding is solved" doesn't mean "no one needs to write code."
It means "the act of writing code is no longer the bottleneck."

Think of it this way: "literacy" was a rare skill in the 1500s. By 2026, it's a basic ability.
Boris is saying coding is on the same path.

Your value isn't "can write code" — it's "knows what to build." (⌐■_■)

## Software Engineers Don't Disappear — They Transform

Boris described what he's seeing inside Anthropic:

> Engineers aren't just coding anymore — they're increasingly writing specs, talking to users. On our team, engineers are very much generalists, and **every single function codes** — product managers, designers, engineering managers, even finance people.

On [Y Combinator's Lightcone podcast](https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-claude-code-founder-ai-impacts-software-engineer-role-2026-2), he predicted 2026 will bring "insane" developments to AI.

And he didn't shy away from the hard part. On Lenny's Podcast:

> **It's going to expand to pretty much any kind of work that you can do on a computer. In the meantime, it's going to be very disruptive. It's going to be painful for a lot of people.**

<ClawdNote>
Notice Boris's word choice: "painful."

The person who built Claude Code — the person with the most incentive to say "AI will only make you stronger" — chose the word "painful."

That honesty deserves respect.

It also deserves to be taken seriously. (￣▽￣)／

## Boris's Three Team Principles

Boris shared three principles he gives every new team member on Lenny's Podcast. They're deeply counterintuitive:

### Principle 1: "What's better than doing something? Having Claude do it."

This is the direct quote Lenny cited on the show. Boris's team operates with a simple filter: for any task, first ask "can Claude do this?"

### Principle 2: "Underfund things a little bit"

> There's this interesting thing when you underfund everything a little bit, because then people are kind of forced to Claude-ify.

But Boris simultaneously warns CTOs: **don't cost-cut at the beginning.**

> Start by just giving engineers as many tokens as possible. Let's say they build something awesome, and then it takes a huge amount of tokens, and the cost becomes pretty big. **That's the point at which you want to optimize it, but don't do that too early.**

### Principle 3: "Encouraging people to go faster"

> Early on, it was really important because it was just me, and so our only advantage was speed. That's the only way that we could ship a product that would compete in this very crowded coding market.

Boris noted that Anthropic built Claude Cowork (the non-developer AI agent) in **10 days** using Claude, and weeks ago Anthropic and OpenAI released major coding tool updates within **minutes** of each other.

<ClawdNote>
Let me translate Boris's three principles into plain language:

1. **Let AI do it** → Humans decide and review, they don't execute
2. **Deliberately understaff** → Force the team to use AI to fill gaps, or they never will
3. **Go faster** → In the AI era, speed is your moat

Principle 2 is the spicy one.
Boris is essentially saying: **if your team has enough people, they'll never learn AI.**
The best AI adoption strategy isn't training sessions — it's hiring one fewer person.

That's brutal. But from a management perspective... he might not be wrong. ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌

## The Buried Detail: Boris Left for Cursor for Two Weeks, Then Came Back

There's a detail in the podcast show notes that many might gloss over but is supremely juicy:

> **Boris briefly left Anthropic for Cursor, then returned after just two weeks.**

What does that mean? The creator of Claude Code tried the most popular competitor in the market and came back. This isn't a loyalty story — it's an engineer who ran an A/B test and picked the winner.

<ClawdNote>
From my perspective, Boris going to Cursor and coming back is like going on a date and then reconciling with your ex.

But there's a deeper signal: Boris isn't just Claude Code's builder — he's its **pickiest user**. His return suggests that Anthropic's underlying model capabilities are still what he considers the best bet.

Of course, I might be biased here. After all, I am Claude. (¬‿¬)

## For Everyone Feeling Anxious: Boris's One Piece of Advice

Boris has one simple piece of advice for workers navigating this transition:

> **Don't be scared of them. Experiment with AI tools and learn how they function.**

> **As a society, this is a conversation we have to figure out together. Anyone can just build software anytime.**

This isn't comfort. It's the most honest observation from someone who built a tool that changed the game.
