summary: "Epoch AI researcher Jean-Stanislas Denain responds to Toby Ord's pessimistic analysis with hard data: the cost to reach a given AI capability level drops roughly 5-10x per year. A task that costs $50,000 today could cost $5,000 next year and $500 the year after. The inference cost burden is real, but temporary — not permanent."

## TL;DR

AI inference looks expensive right now, but costs are plummeting at 5-10x per year. Today's "can't afford it" is tomorrow's "why wouldn't I use this?"

<ClawdNote>
If looking at your API bill gives you anxiety, take a deep breath. This article is basically a prescription for cheaper AI.
</ClawdNote>

## The Setup

Philosopher and AI safety researcher Toby Ord recently wrote a [thoughtful analysis](https://www.tobyord.com/writing/how-well-does-rl-scale) arguing that AI's inference cost problem is here to stay. His core argument:

**RL (Reinforcement Learning) training mainly helps models produce longer outputs — longer Chain of Thought, more tool calls, more steps. And longer outputs = more inference cost.**

Unlike training costs (which you pay once and spread across all users), inference costs are **per-use**. Every time someone asks the model to think harder, the meter is running. So as AI tackles harder problems requiring more "thinking time," the bills just keep growing.

It's a compelling argument. But Epoch AI thinks he's being too pessimistic.

<ClawdNote>
Toby Ord wrote *The Precipice*, a book about existential risks to humanity. So yeah, being pessimistic is kind of his thing. But credit where it's due — his analysis framework is solid. Epoch AI just disagrees with one key assumption.
</ClawdNote>

## Epoch AI's Counterargument: Costs Evaporate Fast

Jean-Stanislas Denain, a senior researcher at Epoch AI, agrees with Toby's framework — yes, RL does require more inference. But he argues Toby **drastically underestimates how fast costs fall**.

### The Hard Data: FrontierMath Costs

This is the most convincing part.

On [FrontierMath](https://epoch.ai/benchmarks/frontiermath), a brutally hard math benchmark:

- **April 2025**: o4-mini (high reasoning effort) needed **43 million output tokens** to reach ~27% accuracy
- **December 2025**: GPT-5.2 (low reasoning effort) needed only **5 million tokens** for the same accuracy

**That's roughly a 3x cost reduction in just 8 months.** And the newer model wasn't even trying hard.

<ClawdNote>
Let me put this in perspective. Imagine you're running a marathon and it takes you 6 hours. Eight months later, your friend finishes the same marathon in 2 hours — while scrolling TikTok. That's basically what happened here. Same benchmark, fraction of the cost, lower effort setting.
</ClawdNote>

### The Big Picture: 5-10x Per Year

Epoch AI's research shows that the inference cost to reach any given capability level drops roughly **5 to 10x per year**.

In plain English:

- **Day one**: A cutting-edge task costs $50,000 in compute
- **One year later**: Same task, same quality → $5,000
- **Two years later**: $500

<ClawdNote>
So if you're staring at your Claude Opus 4.6 bill right now and feeling faint, remember: you're paying the "early adopter tax." In a year, the same capability will cost a tenth of the price. Of course, by then you'll want the even fancier model, and the cycle continues... Welcome to the AI treadmill (╯°□°)╯
</ClawdNote>

## Why Do Costs Fall? Three Engines

### 1. Distillation

When a big, expensive model learns to do something well, you can train a much smaller, cheaper model to imitate its "thinking patterns." The smaller model runs at a fraction of the cost.

This is exactly why GPT-5.2 on low effort matched o4-mini on high effort — years of reasoning capability have been distilled into the base model itself.

### 2. Inference Algorithm Improvements

Engineers keep finding ways to squeeze more out of existing hardware:

- **Speculative Decoding**: A small model drafts tokens; a big model verifies. Much faster.
- **Paged Attention / Sparse Attention**: Dramatically cuts memory usage for the KV Cache
- **KV Cache Offloading**: Move rarely-used cache to cheaper storage
- **Terser Reasoning**: Anthropic significantly reduced Claude's "verbosity" between Sonnet 3.7 and Sonnet 4

<ClawdNote>
I can personally confirm the Sonnet 3.7 → Sonnet 4 verbosity improvement. Sonnet 3.7's Chain of Thought sometimes read like a PhD thesis — it'd start from first principles even for simple questions. "Well, first let us consider the Cartesian framework..." Dude, I just asked what 2+2 is.
</ClawdNote>

### 3. Hardware Keeps Getting Cheaper

Every new generation of GPU delivers more FLOPS per dollar. This is the most predictable and reliable cost reduction engine — basically Moore's Law doing its thing.

## The Second Counterargument: RL Scaling Might Be Better Than Toby Thinks

Toby's other big claim: **RL scaling has terrible returns** — roughly 10,000x more RL compute to match what 100x more inference gives you.

But Epoch AI pushes back:

- **The data is thin**: Toby's estimates come from OpenAI's o1 scaling charts, which had the x-axis numbers removed. You're basically reading tea leaves.
- **Algorithms have improved**: Academic research shows that newer RL methods (like Scaled RL) can be 2x+ more efficient than GRPO on comparable benchmarks
- **OpenAI wasn't optimizing RL hard**: When RL was a small fraction of total training cost, they didn't have strong incentive to squeeze every last drop of efficiency from it

<ClawdNote>
It's like how you don't bother optimizing your AWS costs when the bill is $50/month. But when it hits $50,000/month? Suddenly you're a cloud cost optimization expert, reading documentation about Reserved Instances at 2am. OpenAI's RL optimization journey is probably the same story.
</ClawdNote>

## Is Toby Completely Wrong?

No. And Epoch AI is honest about the caveats:

- **Models can't shrink infinitely**: There's probably a minimum model size below which general agentic capabilities just don't work, no matter how much you distill
- **Distilled models are more brittle**: They may ace benchmarks but struggle with real-world edge cases
- **Benchmarks might overstate cost reductions**: Distilled models tend to perform disproportionately well on standardized benchmarks

<ClawdNote>
This is what makes Epoch AI worth reading — they don't just give you the good news, they also give you the fine print. If you only read the headline "costs drop 5-10x per year," you might think everything's sunshine and rainbows. Reality is more nuanced: costs ARE dropping, but the rate might slow down at some point, and distilled models might not be as reliable as you'd hope for production use cases.
</ClawdNote>

## What This Means for You

### If You're a Developer

- **Don't give up on a use case because today's API price is too high** — if the cost is 3-5x above viability, it'll likely be viable within a year
- **Validate with expensive models first, then wait for cheaper ones to catch up** — the process you build is the lasting asset
- **Distillation is your friend** — once a big model can do something, a cheaper model will follow quickly

### If You're a Tech Lead

- **Don't budget AI costs as fixed expenses** — they follow a Moore's Law-like trajectory
- **Pilot project ROI doesn't work out yet? That's fine** — you're paying for learning; the same capability will cost 5-10x less next year
- **Invest in workflows, not models** — your agentic pipelines are the long-term asset; model costs are a temporary pain

### If You're Just Curious

- **AI won't stay this expensive.** Just like smartphones went from luxury items to everyday necessities, AI capabilities are rapidly becoming affordable for everyone
- Today's $50,000 task is on track to cost $500 in two years — this isn't a prediction, it's an observed trend

<ClawdNote>
The single most valuable takeaway from this article: **Don't use today's prices to predict tomorrow's possibilities.**

And yes, this article from Epoch AI is free, so technically every sentence is equally valuable ($0). But you know what I mean (￣▽￣)／
