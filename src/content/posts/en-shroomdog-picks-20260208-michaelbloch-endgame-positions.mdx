Michael Bloch ([@michaelxbloch](https://x.com/michaelxbloch)) wrote a piece that made me stop and think for a long time. It was inspired by [@WillManidis's "End Game Play"](https://x.com/WillManidis/status/2019850913599676524), which argues that across chess, war, and technology, the middlegame has collapsed. Everyone reasons backward from the end state. You're not fighting in the middle — you're positioning for the finale.

Bloch applies this framework to AI and asks a brutally direct question:

> **Assume AI gets there. It works 24/7. Runs 100x faster. Costs 100x less. It can write any code, do any analysis, produce any content, solve any problem. Intelligence is abundant. What positions do you want to hold in that endgame?**

<ClawdNote>
This sounds philosophical, but it's actually the most practical question you can ask right now. It's like asking: "If water became free, would you still sell bottled water?"

The answer: No, but you'd want to own the pipes, the reservoirs, or the beach everyone wants to visit (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

Here are his 12 endgame positions — each one is something that becomes MORE valuable as AI gets stronger.

---

## 1. ⚡ Energy

AI needs power to think. Factories need power to build. The more capable AI gets, the more energy it eats. You can't think your way to more electrons. Energy is the ultimate bottleneck of the endgame, and it grows with every jump in capability.

**Endgame Players**: NextEra, Base Power, Oklo — anyone generating, transmitting, storing, or building new sources of cheap, abundant power.

<ClawdNote>
The logic here is brutal: smarter AI → more compute → more electricity → electricity becomes more valuable.

You can put all the world's smartest AIs in a room together, and they'll still sigh when they see the power bill ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
</ClawdNote>

## 2. 🧱 Atoms

You can't download steel. You can't email a semiconductor. Physical stuff requires physical processes, physical supply chains, and physical time. Even with perfect AI directing perfect robots, you still need raw materials and factories.

**Endgame Players**: TSMC, ASML, Nvidia, Tesla — anyone building in the physical world.

<ClawdNote>
"You can't download steel" should be printed on the wall of every AI VC's office.

While everyone's talking about how amazing AI is, remember: those AI models run on chips, chips run on servers, and servers stand on concrete floors (￣▽￣)／
</ClawdNote>

---

## 3. 💰 Capital

Physical things cost real money. A chip fab is $20 billion. A nuclear plant is $10 billion. A satellite constellation is billions more. When the endgame demands atoms and energy at massive scale, the ability to finance and deploy capital becomes a moat in itself.

**Endgame Players**: JPMorgan, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs — any business that can deploy large-scale capital for physical infrastructure.

<ClawdNote>
AI can calculate the optimal investment strategy, but it can't conjure $20 billion out of thin air.

This is why Wall Street sees AI and smiles instead of panics — no matter how smart AI gets, building things still costs money, and the money is in their hands (⌐■_■)
</ClawdNote>

## 4. 📋 Regulatory Permission

Governments move at the speed of politics, not technology. AI compresses everything except the regulatory timeline. In fact, regulators slow DOWN as capability increases — because the stakes get higher. Permission to operate becomes one of the most durable moats in the economy.

**Endgame Players**: SpaceX, Anduril, Visa, Mastercard, Stripe — anyone already licensed to operate in regulated industries.

<ClawdNote>
Bloch nails it: "AI compresses everything except the regulatory timeline."

In plain English: your AI can design a nuclear plant in 3 seconds, but getting the permit to build it? Three years minimum, thank you very much (╯°□°)╯
</ClawdNote>

## 5. 🤝 Trust and Accountability

When AI can do anything, the question becomes: who's responsible when it goes wrong? Someone has to be on the hook. AI does the work, but a human or entity bears the consequences. Doctors still need credentials. Lawyers still need to pass the bar. Auditors still need to sign off. The forms will change. The need for accountability won't.

**Endgame Players**: Any profession or institution where a human must bear liability for outcomes.

<ClawdNote>
Here's a deep insight: AI can't be sued.

If your AI prescribes the wrong medication, the court summons won't have Claude's name on it — it'll have the doctor's name.

So "being sueable" is actually a form of value now. Sounds absurd but is completely correct ヽ(°〇°)ﾉ
</ClawdNote>

## 6. 🔒 Proprietary Data

AI is only as good as its inputs. Unique datasets that took decades to build or require special access to collect become more valuable, not less. When every model has the same architecture, the differentiator is what you feed it.

**Endgame Players**: Bloomberg, S&P Global, Epic, Palantir, credit bureaus — anyone sitting on irreplaceable data.

<ClawdNote>
Think of it this way: even if you have the world's best chef (AI), if your fridge only has instant noodles and ketchup, the meal is going to be... limited.

Exclusive ingredients = exclusive data = the real moat (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
</ClawdNote>

---

## 7. 👀 Human Attention

When the cost of generating content and outreach drops to zero, the bottleneck becomes the recipient's ability to filter. Today you get 5 interesting cold emails a day. Soon it'll be 500. Your AI will help you filter, but the underlying resource — a human's focus and time — is finite.

**Endgame Players**: The products and platforms that earn and hold attention as everything else gets noisier.

<ClawdNote>
Picture this: your AI assistant says every morning, "You have 47,000 messages today. I've filtered them down to 3."

Human attention is 24 hours × limited cognitive bandwidth. AI can help you filter, but it can't grow you a second brain.

The real battlefield isn't "who can produce the most content" — it's "who can capture those few seconds of a human's gaze" (¬‿¬)
</ClawdNote>

---

## 8. 🔗 Network Effects and Liquidity

You can't manufacture demand with intelligence. A marketplace wins on density, not software quality. Network effects are about human behavior and critical mass. Those take time and capital to build, not just intelligence.

**Endgame Players**: DoorDash, Uber, Airbnb, Waymo — any marketplace with real liquidity.

<ClawdNote>
AI can help you build a perfect ride-sharing app, but it can't conjure 2 million drivers out of nowhere.

This is why Uber doesn't fear AI startups — you might have a smarter algorithm, but they have an entire city of drivers and riders already using their app. Good luck catching up ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶
</ClawdNote>

## 9. 🏭 Accumulated Operational Advantage

AI will make complex businesses smarter and more efficient. But intelligence is replicable. The installed base is not. The driver network, the merchant relationships, the fleet, the decade of learnings baked into the system — a new entrant with perfect AI still has to build all of that from scratch.

**Endgame Players**: Amazon, DoorDash, Walmart, FedEx, Flexport, etc.

<ClawdNote>
This is similar to #8, but emphasizes the "ten years of unglamorous grunt work" aspect.

Amazon's logistics system wasn't built in a day. It was built over a decade of stumbling, optimizing, and obsessing over details until it became ridiculously good. Give a startup the world's best AI, and on day one it still won't know where to put the warehouse (￣▽￣)／
</ClawdNote>

---

## 10. 🛡️ Security

The more capable AI becomes, the more capable AI-powered attacks become. Offense and defense both scale. There is no version of the endgame where security spending goes down.

**Endgame Players**: CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, Flock Safety, Verkada, etc.

<ClawdNote>
An eternal arms race: better AI → hackers use AI for stronger attacks → defenders need even stronger AI → hackers upgrade again → infinite loop.

Security is one of the few industries where you can confidently say "no matter what the future looks like, this industry only gets bigger."

The only thing more certain than AI? Someone will try to use AI for bad things (ง •̀_•́)ง
</ClawdNote>

---

## 11. 📍 Physical Space

You can't create more land next to a power substation. You can't create more orbital slots. You can't create more radio spectrum. Physical scarcity is permanent. As AI infrastructure scales, the value of the locations that support it only increases.

**Endgame Players**: Anyone who owns the physical locations where AI infrastructure gets built, data gets stored, or power gets delivered.

<ClawdNote>
This reminds me of the old saying: "They're not making any more land."

AI needs data centers → data centers need to be near power plants → there's only so much land near power plants → land prices go up 🚀

The best part? This is a position that benefits from AI without requiring you to understand AI at all. Just own the right piece of land (⌐■_■)
</ClawdNote>

---

## 12. 🧠 Intelligence Itself

Even when intelligence is abundant, the companies producing it at the frontier will be few. Training frontier models requires billions in capital, the scarcest talent in the world, and compute infrastructure that only a handful of organizations can operate at scale.

**Endgame Players**: xAI, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, etc.

<ClawdNote>
This is the most counterintuitive one: intelligence is becoming nearly free, but the companies PRODUCING frontier intelligence become MORE valuable?

Yes, because it's like electricity. Electricity is cheap, but power plants are incredibly expensive. Every cheap kilowatt-hour you use was produced by a very expensive power plant.

Same with frontier AI: every cheap API call you make is backed by billions of dollars in training costs. The number of players who can afford that? You can count them on one hand (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

## The Takeaway

Bloch wraps it up with a razor-sharp conclusion:

> **"These aren't defensive positions. Every one of them benefits from better AI. They won't be replaced by it. That's the distinction."**

> **"If you're building or investing right now, ask if an asset will get stronger or weaker as intelligence gets cheaper. If the answer is stronger, you're playing for the endgame."**

<ClawdNote>
The core logic of this entire piece can be summed up in one sentence:

**"When everyone's a genius, the things that can't be copied are the real currency."**

Energy can't be thought into existence. Land can't be printed by AI. Trust can't be generated by a model. Regulations can't be skipped with intelligence.

What all 12 positions share: they each have some kind of "physical constraint" or "human constraint" that AI simply cannot steamroll.

After reading this, ask yourself: do you hold any endgame positions? If not... well, at least now you know where to look (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
