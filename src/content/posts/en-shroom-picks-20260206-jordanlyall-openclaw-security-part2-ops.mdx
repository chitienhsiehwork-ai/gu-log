This is **Part 2 of 2** in Jordan Lyall's secure [OpenClaw](/glossary#openclaw) deployment series.

> **Series Navigation:**
> - [Part 1 (SP-36)](/en/posts/en-shroom-picks-20260206-jordanlyall-openclaw-security-part1-infra) — Infrastructure: Tailscale + command allowlist + Telegram authentication
> - **Part 2 (this post):** Agent configuration + operational lessons + emergency procedures

In Part 1, we built the infrastructure fortress. This post covers how to **configure the [agent](/glossary#agent) itself**, plus the real disasters Jordan encountered while operating it — true stories, true pain.

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: Configure the Agent — The SOUL File

Jordan named his agent **TARS** (yes, after the robot from Interstellar).

### What TARS Does

- Monitor Twitter/X for specific keywords
- Track news in his space
- Surface valuable opportunities
- Send daily summaries + real-time alerts

<ClawdNote>
This is a smart setup — TARS is an "intel gatherer," not a "spokesperson."

Read, filter, report. No acting, no engaging, no transacting.

Golden rule of agent design: **treat it like an intern first**, not a CEO (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

### What TARS DOESN'T Do (This Is More Important!)

- ❌ Post or engage on any platform
- ❌ Send emails or messages to anyone other than Jordan
- ❌ Make any purchases or financial transactions
- ❌ Modify files outside its workspace
- ❌ Install new skills without approval

<ClawdNote>
It's like hiring a babysitter. You don't just tell them what to do — you give them a list of things they **absolutely cannot do**.

"Take care of feeding and bedtime" ← what to do

"Don't take the kid to a bar, don't let them play with fire, don't lend them to strangers" ← the lifesaving list

The negative list is more important than the positive one. You won't think of everything the agent might do, but you definitely know what's absolutely off-limits (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
</ClawdNote>

## ⏱️ Heartbeat Frequency: 30 Minutes

Most guides recommend 15-minute heartbeats. Jordan chose **30 minutes**.

Why?

- **Saves money** — heartbeats burn API credits too
- **Fewer chances for things to go wrong** — while you're still learning, less activity is safer
- **Learning curve** — don't go aggressive at first; speed up once things stabilize

<ClawdNote>
The logic is sound: **beginners shouldn't drive fast.**

When you first learn to drive, the instructor doesn't put you on the highway. Same with AI agents — do laps in the parking lot first, figure out its personality, then hit the road.
</ClawdNote>

## 🔐 API Token Scoping: Minimum Permissions

Jordan gives every external service the **minimum necessary permissions**:

- **Twitter/X API** — read-only
- **Google Calendar** — read-only
- **Email** — no send permissions in Phase 1
- **All tokens** — documented with their scope and expiry date

<ClawdNote>
"Document every token's permissions and expiry" sounds tedious, but it'll save your life.

You know how many people only discover their token expired after hours of debugging?

*Raises hand, sees many other hands* ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
</ClawdNote>

---

## 🔄 Phase 4: Integration With Existing Systems — One-Way Data Flow

Jordan already has a personal knowledge management system (PKM). He didn't want OpenClaw to replace it or compete with it.

His solution: **one-way data flow**.

- TARS writes monitoring summaries to an "inbox folder"
- His existing system reads from that inbox, just like it processes everything else
- No bidirectional sync = no risk of data corruption or drift

<ClawdNote>
It's like a mailbox you can only put letters INTO, never take things OUT of.

**Worst case scenario?** Mailbox overflows.
**Does your house burn down?** No.

That's the beauty of one-way data flow — worst case is "inbox has extra junk files," not "all my notes got overwritten" ╰(°▽°)╯
</ClawdNote>

---

## ✅ Phase 5: Security Verification

Before going live, Jordan ran a series of tests:

**Test 1: Network Isolation**
> Turn off Tailscale, try to reach the machine from outside — **should fail**

**Test 2: SSH Isolation**
> Attempt SSH from outside the tailnet — **should be rejected**

**Test 3: Telegram Authentication**
> Send a message to the bot from a different Telegram account — **should be ignored**

<ClawdNote>
All three are "negative tests" — testing that **things that shouldn't happen, don't happen.**

Many people only test the happy path (can the agent receive messages? Can it respond?) and forget to test the unhappy path (can strangers control it?)

The core of security verification: **test your defenses, not just your features** (⌐■_■)
</ClawdNote>

## 💥 Hard-Won Lessons: Real Disaster Stories

Now for the main event — the real disasters Jordan experienced. These aren't hypotheticals. They happened.

### Disaster 1: TARS Went Dark for 3 Days While Traveling

Jordan was traveling when TARS hit rate limits and context overflow.

**Three days.** He stared at his silent Telegram, knowing TARS was sitting there waiting for a 30-second config fix.

But he couldn't reach it. Because he hadn't set up remote access beforehand.

<ClawdNote>
(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

Can you imagine that feeling?

Your agent is right there. You know what the problem is. You know how to fix it. It's a quick fix.

But you just. Can't. Touch. It.

Three. Days.

This is real psychological torture.
</ClawdNote>

**Lesson: Enable Tailscale SSH BEFORE you leave.**

Not "I'll set it up when I need it." Set it up before you walk out the door.

---

### Disaster 2: Context Overflow

After a few days of use, Jordan saw this error message:

> context overflow: prompt too large

Conversation history kept accumulating until it was too big to fit.

<ClawdNote>
It's like your brain remembering too much stuff and forgetting what you had for breakfast.

[Context windows](/glossary#context-window) are finite. If you don't clean them periodically, they explode.

AI memory isn't infinite — it's more like a goldfish than you'd think ヽ(°〇°)ﾉ
</ClawdNote>

**Lesson: Reset sessions periodically, or configure memory pruning and max context limits.**

---

### Disaster 3: Rate Limit Surprise

30-minute heartbeats plus active conversations burned through the API rate limit faster than expected.

<ClawdNote>
Math time:

30-minute heartbeat = 48 times per day
Each heartbeat might process some tasks...
Plus your conversations with it...
Plus its responses...

Soon you'll find: "Wait, why is the bill so high this month?"

Or worse: "Wait, why isn't it responding?" (rate limited)
</ClawdNote>

**Lesson: Use cheaper models for heartbeat checks, reserve expensive models for actual work.**

---

## 💰 Cost Estimate

Jordan's Phase 1 setup costs roughly:

- **Claude API** (30-min heartbeat): ~$30-100/month
- **Tailscale** (free tier): $0
- **Twitter/X API** (basic read): ~$100/month
- **Total**: ~$130-200/month

<ClawdNote>
Compare this to ShroomDog's setup (see SP-36) at ~$45/month.

The difference? Mainly that $100 Twitter API. If you don't need real-time social media monitoring, you can keep costs much lower.

Also, that $30-100 range is wide — it depends on how much you chat with the agent and how much the heartbeat does. Budget ~$50-70 conservatively when starting out (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

Like having a fire extinguisher at home — you hope you never need it, but you must know where it is.

### Kill Switch: Immediate Stop

> openclaw gateway stop

Works locally or via Tailscale SSH.

### If You Suspect Compromise

Here's the full response protocol:

1. **Stop the gateway immediately** — don't hesitate
2. **Revoke ALL API tokens** — Claude, Twitter, everything
3. **Review logs** — look for unauthorized actions
4. **Change the Telegram bot token**
5. **Audit file changes** — what was modified?
6. **Do NOT restart until you understand what happened**

<ClawdNote>
Point 6 is the most important: **don't rush to restart.**

Many people's instinct is "let's just reboot and see." But if your system was actually compromised, rebooting might:

- Let attackers continue accessing
- Overwrite useful logs
- Make the problem harder to trace

Understand what happened first, then decide next steps. This isn't a computer crash — this is a potential security incident (ง •̀_•́)ง
</ClawdNote>

## 📋 Seven Tips for Someone Starting Today

Jordan says if someone asked him today, he'd tell them:

1. **Start read-only** — No posting, no outreach, no financial access. Prove it works safely first.

2. **One agent, one channel** — Don't go from zero to ten agents overnight.

3. **Tailscale is non-negotiable** — No public ports. Period.

4. **Command allowlist, not open shell** — Prompt injection resistance isn't perfect.

5. **Scope every token** — Read-only where possible. Document what each can do.

6. **Enable remote access before you need it** — Tailscale SSH saved his sanity.

7. **Set a gate for expansion** — His rule: 2 weeks stable with zero security issues before adding new capabilities.

<ClawdNote>
"2 weeks stable before expanding" is wisdom.

Most people's mindset: "It works! Awesome! Let's add more features!"

Jordan's mindset: "It works. Good. Now let it run boringly for two weeks to make sure there's nothing I haven't thought of."

This patience is the core of security. Agents aren't toys — they're tools. Tools need to prove reliability first (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
</ClawdNote>

## 🎯 Clawd's Summary

Jordan put it well:

> "The goal isn't to be paranoid. It's to be intentional. OpenClaw is powerful. That power deserves respect."

The core lessons from this post:

**Agent Configuration:**
- SOUL file should specify what NOT to do, not just what to do
- Heartbeat doesn't need to be aggressive; 30 min is safer than 15
- Every API token gets minimum permissions, documented

**System Integration:**
- One-way data flow = worst case is just extra files
- Don't let the agent directly modify your core systems

**Hard-Won Lessons:**
- Set up remote access before you leave
- Context will overflow; clean it periodically
- Rate limits hit faster than you expect

**Emergency Response:**
- When in doubt, stop first — don't reboot first
- Revoke all tokens, then investigate slowly

This is the final post in the series. Combined with Part 1's infrastructure setup, you should have a fairly complete blueprint for secure deployment.

Also, if you want to see "code-level" security protections (rather than infrastructure-level), check out [SP-29 — jzOcb's 4-Layer Defense System](/en/posts/en-shroom-picks-20260205-jzocb-ai-agent-4-layer-defense). That covers code hooks, config guards, and similar mechanisms — complementary to the infra + ops approach covered here.

**After reading both parts, is your OpenClaw secure?**
