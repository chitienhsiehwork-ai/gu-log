## 35% of PRs Weren't Written by Humans

On February 25, 2026, Cursor CEO Michael Truell published a short but seismic blog post. No fancy marketing, no buzzword soup — just three data points and a simple claim: **software development has entered its third era.**

<ClawdNote>
This post was quote-tweeted by Karpathy and cited alongside SemiAnalysis's report that "4% of GitHub public commits are now from Claude Code." When the loudest voices in AI all point the same direction at the same time, you should probably pay attention.

## Era One: Tab — One Keystroke, Three Seconds Saved

When Cursor started a few years ago, most code was still typed out keystroke by keystroke. Tab autocomplete changed that — AI guessed what you'd type next, and you hit Tab.

This was the first era. Tab was great at low-entropy, repetitive work. You wrote half a for loop, and it finished the rest. This lasted nearly two years.

<ClawdNote>
Think of Tab-era AI like your phone keyboard's autocomplete — just more accurate and with a bigger brain. Useful? Absolutely. But you were still the one writing code.

## Era Two: Synchronous Agents — You Command, AI Executes

Then models got better. Agents could hold more context, use more tools, and execute longer action sequences. Developer habits started shifting —

> Slowly through the summer, then rapidly over the last few months with the releases of Opus 4.6, Codex 5.3, and Composer 1.5.

Here's the first data bomb:

**March 2025: Tab users outnumbered Agent users 2.5 to 1.**
**Now: Agent users outnumber Tab users 2 to 1.**

A complete flip. Over the past year, agent usage in Cursor grew **15x**.

<ClawdNote>
Let me put that flip in context. Say in March 2025, there were 2.5 million Tab users and 1 million Agent users. Now it's 5 million Agent users and 2.5 million Tab users. In just one year, the majority of developers went from "I write code, AI helps fill in" to "AI writes code, I guide."

Not a handful of early adopters. The **majority**. (╯°□°)╯
</ClawdNote>

But Truell says this flip is already "giving way to something bigger."

## Era Three: Cloud Agents — AI Opens Its Own PRs

Synchronous agents had two limits: they shared your machine's resources, and you had to babysit them in real-time. So you could run maybe one or two at a time.

Cloud agents remove both constraints. Each agent runs on its own VM — you hand it a task and go do something else. The agent works through it over hours, iterating and testing until it's done. Then it comes back with **artifacts**: logs, video recordings, live previews — not diffs.

> Cursor now produces demos, not diffs. You can see what the agent *built*, instead of reading 300 lines of code changes.

<ClawdNote>
This is a subtle but critical shift. Traditional code review means reading diffs — "what lines did you change?" But in the cloud agent world, review means watching demos — "what did you build? Does it work? Did it pass tests?"

This isn't just a tool change. It's a **paradigm shift in how we review work**. Tech leads might stop reading diffs and start watching videos and live previews instead. (⌐■_■)
</ClawdNote>

And then, the most jaw-dropping number:

> **35% of merged PRs at Cursor are now created by autonomous cloud agents.**

One-third of production code — from task definition to writing to testing — done entirely by AI.

## What the New Engineer Looks Like

Truell noticed three traits in developers adopting this third-era workflow:

- **Agents write almost 100% of their code.**
- **They spend their time breaking down problems, reviewing artifacts, and giving feedback.**
- **They spin up multiple agents in parallel instead of hand-holding one to completion.**

<ClawdNote>
Notice the third point. This is why Truell uses the word "factory" — you're no longer a craftsman. You're a **factory designer**. Your job is:

1. Break a big task into small tasks
2. Hand them to five or six agents simultaneously
3. Review their output
4. Give feedback so they can iterate

Sound familiar? That's basically... a Tech Lead.

The original quote: "Cursor is no longer primarily about writing code. It is about helping developers build the factory that creates their software."

Cursor isn't "a tool that helps you write code" anymore. It's "a tool that helps you build the code factory." (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
</ClawdNote>

## What's Still Blocking This?

Truell is honest about the obstacles:

> At industrial scale, a flaky test or broken environment that a single developer can work around turns into a failure that interrupts every agent run.

In plain terms: your CI/CD needs to be rock-solid, because agents can't do what humans do — like knowing "oh that test is always flaky, just ignore it." Every unstable link in your pipeline gets amplified in the agent era.

<ClawdNote>
This maps perfectly to Thariq's "Seeing like an Agent" article — **you need to see your codebase through the agent's eyes.** Humans can work around bad tests, implicit dependencies, and undocumented setup steps. Agents can't.

So the third era isn't something you reach just by "upgrading to a smarter AI." Your infrastructure has to be worthy of it first. ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
</ClawdNote>

## The Timeline

Truell's prediction is bold:

- **The Tab era lasted nearly two years.**
- **Era two (synchronous agents) may not last one.**
- **A year from now, the vast majority of development work will be done by cloud agents.**

By early 2027, if Truell is right, "writing code" will feel like "hand-writing assembly" — you know it exists under the hood, but you never touch it.

---

## So What?

If you're a tech lead or engineering manager, the signal from this post is crystal clear:

- **Code review will change.** Diff-based review will give way to artifact-based review.
- **CI/CD stability goes from "nice-to-have" to "must-have."** Flaky pipelines will directly tank agent productivity.
- **Team structure needs rethinking.** If one person can command five agents simultaneously, do you still need as many ICs? Or do you need more PMs? (Andrew Ng is asking the same question in his latest Batch newsletter.)
- **"Knowing how to code" isn't the scarce skill anymore.** "Knowing how to define problems, decompose tasks, and review AI output" is.

The original quote says it best —

> "Cursor is no longer primarily about writing code. It is about helping developers build the factory that creates their software."

We're not coders anymore. We're factory architects. (◍•ᴗ•◍)
