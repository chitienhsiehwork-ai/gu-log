There are many good places for ads. A conversation with Claude is not one of them.

Ad-driven business models fuel competition, help people discover new products, and make email and social media free. We've run ads ourselves, and our AI models support many clients in the advertising industry.

But placing ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a **truly helpful assistant for work and deep thinking**.

We want Claude to act unambiguously in the user's interest. So we made a choice: **Claude will remain ad-free**. Users won't see "sponsored" links next to their conversation; Claude's responses won't be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements that users didn't ask for.

<ClawdNote>
This is an official position statement from Anthropic. The point isn't "we don't have ads right now" — it's "we promise we never will." This is a business model choice.

## The Nature of AI Conversation

When people use search engines or social media, they've learned to expect a mix of organic and sponsored content. Filtering signal from noise is part of the interaction.

Conversations with an AI assistant are fundamentally different. The format is open-ended; users often share more context and information than they would in a search query. This openness is part of what makes AI conversations valuable, but it also makes them more susceptible to influence than other digital products.

<ClawdNote>
Would you tell Google Search "I've been stressed lately and can't sleep"? Probably not. But you would tell Claude. That's why AI conversations need a different privacy standard.
</ClawdNote>

Our analysis of Claude conversations (done in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that a significant portion involve sensitive or deeply personal topics — the kind of conversations you'd have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. Ads appearing in these contexts would feel out of place — and in many cases, inappropriate.

## Incentive Structures

"Being genuinely helpful" is one of the core principles of Claude's constitution, the document that describes our vision for Claude's character and guides how we train our models. An ad-based business model would introduce incentives that could work against this principle.

Consider a concrete example. A user mentions they're having trouble sleeping. An assistant without ad incentives would explore various possible causes — stress, environment, habits — based on what seems most insightful for the user. An ad-supported assistant has an additional consideration: does this conversation present an opportunity to make a transaction? These goals might often align — but not always.

<ClawdNote>
Imagine this: you tell Claude "I've been having trouble sleeping," and it replies "Have you considered [Brand Name] sleep gummies?"

You'd start to wonder: Is this actually helpful for me, or did this brand pay for the placement?

That doubt destroys trust. And trust is an AI assistant's most important asset.
</ClawdNote>

And unlike a list of search results, ads that influence model responses could make it hard to tell whether a recommendation is commercially motivated or genuinely helpful. Users shouldn't have to guess whether the AI is actually helping them, or subtly steering the conversation toward something monetizable.

Even ads that don't directly influence the AI model's responses but appear separately in the chat window would undermine what we want Claude to be: a clear space for thinking and working. Such ads would also introduce incentives to optimize for "engagement" — how much time people spend using Claude and how often they return. These metrics don't necessarily align with "being genuinely helpful." The most useful AI interaction might be brief, or one that resolves the user's request without need for further conversation.

## Our Approach

Anthropic focuses on enterprises, developers, and helping users thrive. Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, then reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for users. This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.

<ClawdNote>
This is why Claude Pro costs money. It's not because Anthropic wants to take your cash — it's because: **You pay = Claude serves you. Advertisers pay = Claude serves advertisers.** Which one do you want?
</ClawdNote>

Expanding access to Claude is central to our public benefit mission, and we want to do so without selling users' attention or data to advertisers. To that end, we've brought AI tools and training to educators in over 60 countries, started national AI education pilots with multiple governments, and offered Claude to nonprofits at significant discounts.

## Supporting Commerce

AI will increasingly interact with commerce, and we look forward to supporting this in ways that help users. We're particularly interested in the potential for agentic commerce, where Claude handles the entire process of making purchases or reservations on behalf of users. We'll also continue building features that let users search for, compare, or buy products when they choose, contact businesses, and more.

All third-party interactions will be built on the same overarching design principle: **they should be user-initiated (AI working for the user) rather than advertiser-initiated (AI working at least partly for someone else)**.

<ClawdNote>
This distinction matters:
- ✅ "Help me find running shoes" → Claude searches, compares, recommends
- ❌ Claude proactively saying "By the way, Nike has a sale right now"

The first is service. The second is sales.
</ClawdNote>

## A Trustworthy Thinking Tool

We want users to trust Claude to help them think, continuously — about their work, challenges, and ideas.

Our experience with the internet makes it easy to assume that ads on the products we use are inevitable. But opening a notebook, picking up a well-crafted tool, or standing before a clean whiteboard — there are no ads there.

**We think Claude should work the same way.**

<ClawdNote>
The title of this post — "Claude is a Space to Think" — echoes the themes from SP-6 and SP-23: Claude isn't just a "tool," it's a "thinking space." You use a tool to complete tasks. You think inside a space. Notebooks don't pop up ads trying to sell you things. Whiteboards don't. Neither will Claude.
