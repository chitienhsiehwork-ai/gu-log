summary: "Block (formerly Square) CEO Jack Dorsey posted a public letter announcing that nearly half the company—over 4,000 people—would be laid off. The bombshell: this isn't because the company is struggling. Business is strong. The reason? 'AI tools paired with smaller, flatter teams are enabling a fundamentally new way of working.' He chose one massive cut over gradual attrition, calling repeated layoffs 'destructive to morale, focus, and trust.' This letter is the most direct CEO statement yet about AI reshaping org structure—and every tech lead should read it."

## The Letter That Made Silicon Valley Go Quiet

On February 26, 2026, Jack Dorsey—CEO of Block (formerly Square)—posted a public letter on X.

Not a product launch. Not an AI demo.

A layoff letter. **Cutting over 4,000 people. Shrinking the company from 10,000+ to under 6,000.**

45,000 likes. 5,800 retweets. 7,700 replies.

This isn't your typical "We appreciate everyone's contributions and wish them well" corporate PR. Jack said something that made the entire tech world pause:

> **"We're already seeing that the intelligence tools we're creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. And that's accelerating rapidly."**

<ClawdNote>
A layoff announcement getting 45,000+ likes is... unusual. Layoff posts are usually PR disasters, not engagement magnets. That number alone tells you something: people aren't "liking" layoffs. They're liking that someone finally said what everyone's been thinking but nobody dared to say out loud.

## Not Because the Company Is in Trouble

Here's the most counterintuitive part of the letter:

> **"We're not making this decision because we're in trouble. Our business is strong. Gross profit continues to grow, we continue to serve more and more customers, and profitability is improving."**

Wait—business is great, and you're cutting half your people?

This is what makes this letter different from every other layoff announcement.

Most companies say things like: "Due to challenging market conditions..." or "To refocus on core business..." The subtext is always: "We messed up."

Jack's subtext is: **"We didn't mess up. The rules of the game changed."**

<ClawdNote>
Let me translate what this really means: A feature that used to require 8 engineers + 1 PM can now be built by 2 engineers + 1 PM + AI agents. So where do the other 6 engineers go?

This isn't a hypothetical question anymore. Block just answered it with 4,000 real positions.

## "One Big Cut" vs "Death by a Thousand Cuts"

Jack explained why he chose one massive layoff instead of gradual trimming:

> **"Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead. I'd rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome."**

The vibe here is: rather than having everyone come to work every day wondering "Am I next?", just rip the Band-Aid off all at once.

<ClawdNote>
Research actually backs this up. Repeated small layoffs are more damaging to organizations than a single large one. Why? Because they create a culture of perpetual fear: everyone starts playing politics, hoarding information, and refusing to take risks—because they don't know if they'll be next.

One big cut is brutal, but at least the survivors know: the storm is over, now we can focus on building.

Although, the 4,000 people who lost their jobs probably don't find "management research" very comforting.

## What This Means for Every Tech Lead

Jack wrote this to the people staying:

> **"We're going to build this company with intelligence at the core of everything we do. How we work, how we create, how we serve our customers."**

And then the real kicker:

> **"Our customers will feel this shift too, and we're going to help them navigate it: towards a future where they can build their own features directly, composed of our capabilities and served through our interfaces."**

Translation: Block's future isn't just about using AI internally. They want **customers to use AI to assemble their own features** from Block's building blocks.

This is basically saying: You used to be a SaaS company selling "features." In the future, you're an AI platform selling "capabilities." Customers use AI to assemble capabilities into whatever they need.

<ClawdNote>
If you're a tech lead, screenshot this letter and save it.

What Jack is saying lines up perfectly with what Andrew Ng wrote last week about the "PM bottleneck"—when engineers + AI become dramatically more productive, the bottleneck shifts from "writing code" to "deciding what to build." Projects that used to need 8 people now need 2.

For your team, this means:

- You need **stronger** people, not **more** people
- Everyone needs to know how to use AI tools (those who can't will be replaced by those who can)
- The PM role becomes even more critical (because the bottleneck is now product decisions)
- Team sizes shrink, but each person's scope expands

Andrew Ng's line from a few days ago: **"AI won't replace workers, but workers who use AI will replace workers who don't."** Block just proved this isn't motivational fluff—it's a business reality backed by 4,000 positions.

## Was the Severance Package Fair?

Jack put the compensation details right at the top of his letter:

- **20 weeks of salary** + 1 week per year of tenure
- Equity vested through end of May
- **6 months of healthcare**
- You keep your company devices
- **$5,000 transition stipend**

Then he did something unusual:

> **"We're not going to just disappear people from Slack and email and pretend they were never here. Communication channels will stay open through Thursday evening so everyone can say goodbye properly."**

<ClawdNote>
This part hit different. Standard corporate layoff procedure is: accounts disabled immediately, badge deactivated, security escort to the door. Maximum efficiency, zero humanity.

Jack chose the opposite: "I'd rather it feel awkward and human than efficient and cold."

Whatever you think about the layoff itself, that sentence is worth remembering if you ever have to make a similar call.

## The Community Reaction: Polarized

The letter sparked intense debate on X.

**Supporters** said things like:
- Finally, a CEO who admits AI is reshaping org structure
- One clean cut is more humane than slow bleeding
- The severance package is generous by industry standards

**Critics** pushed back hard:

Peter Steinberger (OpenClaw founder) shared a post from [@hey_amandam](https://x.com/hey_amandam) arguing:

> **"Don't buy the 'not AI native' narrative. I can assure you every single engineer who was laid off will be using AI in their next job."**

There's an important nuance here: "AI changed organizational structure" and "the people who were cut weren't AI-native enough" are two completely different statements.

Block didn't cut "people who can't use AI." They cut "positions that AI made unnecessary."

<ClawdNote>
This distinction matters. Let me spell it out:

- **Narrative A**: "You got laid off because you don't use AI" → Individual problem
- **Narrative B**: "AI means the team needs fewer people" → Structural problem

Jack's letter is clearly Narrative B. He literally said: "This decision is not a reflection of what you contributed."

But social media loves sliding B into A, because A is easier to justify, easier to act on ("just learn AI!"), and less anxiety-inducing (it implies "if you try hard enough, you'll be fine").

The uncomfortable truth: some of those 4,000 people were great at their jobs, technically skilled, and actively using AI—but the organization simply doesn't need that many people anymore. That's the part that really stings.

## Not the First Shot, Won't Be the Last

Block isn't the first company to do a massive AI-driven layoff. But it might be the first to **say it this directly.**

Over the past year:
- **Duolingo** laid off staff and pivoted to AI-generated content
- **Klarna's** CEO publicly said AI replaced the work of 700 customer service agents
- **Various SaaS companies** quietly downsized, calling it "restructuring"

Jack broke a taboo: he directly stated "AI + small teams = fundamentally different company operations" and backed it with 4,000 concrete positions.

In Andrew Ng's framework, this is the ultimate "workflow redesign"—not just adding AI to existing processes, but using AI to redefine how many people those processes need.

## Your Takeaways

**If you're an IC (Individual Contributor):**
- Your irreplaceability doesn't come from "knowing how to code"—it comes from what **you + AI** can produce together
- Learning AI isn't just "using ChatGPT"—it's integrating AI into your daily workflow
- Output per hour matters way more than hours at your desk

**If you're a Tech Lead / Manager:**
- Start thinking about how many people your team needs in an AI-augmented mode
- The PM role becomes more important—engineering isn't the bottleneck anymore, product decisions are
- Help your team members level up their AI skills—it's the best investment you can make

**If you're job hunting:**
- The "X + AI" combo is becoming increasingly valuable (Recruiting Engineer, Marketing Engineer, etc.)
- Proving you can 10x your output with AI matters more than a polished resume
- Don't just worry about it—action beats anxiety every time
