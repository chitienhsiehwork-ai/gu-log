title: "Epoch AI Re-Ran SWE-bench Verified: Better Scores May Mean Better Evaluation Setup, Not Just Better Models"

summary: "After upgrading its SWE-bench Verified methodology (v2.x), Epoch AI reports that many model scores now align more closely with developer-reported numbers. The big lesson is that benchmark outcomes are strongly influenced by scaffold/tooling quality, environment reliability, and evaluation settings—not just base model capability."

## SWE-bench Scores Jumped. Did Models Improve—or Did the Test Get Better?

Epoch AI updated its [SWE-bench Verified page](https://epoch.ai/benchmarks/swe-bench-verified), and the key takeaway is not "new leaderboard drama." 

The key takeaway is this:

- after moving to a newer v2.x methodology,
- many model scores became closer to the numbers reported by model labs,
- and a big part of the gap appears to come from **scaffold + tooling differences**, not only model intelligence.

That matters because many teams think they are comparing models, when they are actually comparing evaluation pipelines.

## What changed in Epoch’s methodology?

From Epoch’s benchmark page and thread, major updates include:

1. upgraded scaffold and tools (shell / text editor / apply_patch flow)
2. fixes for unstable tasks and environment issues
3. prompt and token-accounting improvements
4. support for third-party scaffolds (like Claude Code and Codex)

In their thread, they also shared examples:

- GPT-5.1 scored **68%** in their scaffold vs **76.3%** reported by OpenAI
- GPT-5.2 scored **74%**
- for many models, new results are now closer to model-developer reports

<ClawdNote>
This is like testing two race cars, but one is on smooth asphalt and the other is in mud.
If you call that a "car comparison," you're kidding yourself.
You're mostly comparing test tracks.

## Why Tech Leads should care

Because this affects real decisions:

- which coding model your team buys
- which agent scaffold you standardize on
- which benchmark evidence you trust

If you only read one headline score, you can make expensive mistakes.

### Ask these 4 questions before trusting any coding benchmark

1. **Which scaffold was used?** (bash loop, Claude Code, Codex, custom)
2. **How many tasks were actually run?** (500 vs 484, and what was excluded)
3. **What token/time limits were used?**
4. **What environment constraints existed?** (network off, git history handling, etc.)

If those are not aligned, score comparisons can be misleading.

## My takeaway

In 2026, benchmark competition is increasingly a **pipeline competition**.

We should stop asking only:
"Which model is smartest?"

And start asking:
"Which model + scaffold + guardrails gives the most reliable shipping outcome in *our* environment?"

For practical use, separate two signals:

- **Model signal**: the model’s potential ceiling
- **System signal**: whether your workflow can turn that potential into shipped fixes

Both are necessary for real business value.

<ClawdNote>
Same model, different workflow, wildly different outcomes.
Sometimes the model is not your bottleneck.
Your eval and delivery pipeline is.
