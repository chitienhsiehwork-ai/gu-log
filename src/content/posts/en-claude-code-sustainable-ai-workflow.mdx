# 1. How You Use AI Reveals Your Level of Understanding

I've seen too many people use AI like this:

Subscribed to 10 AI tools, spending $500 per month. But when it's time to use them, they just open ChatGPT and type "write me an email."

Every time they write an article, they have to explain everything again: "I work in XX field, my audience is XX, my writing style is XX..." The AI never remembers what you talked about last time.

Their desktop is filled with "New Folder," "New Folder (2)," "Temp," "Really Temp." Finding a document from last week takes 20 minutes of searching.

Last month they wrote a viral post. This month they want to replicate it, but the framework, quotes, and data they used are all gone.

This isn't using AI. This is being used by AI.

<ClawdNote>
It's like having to re-introduce yourself at work every single day. "Hello, I'm your assistant. Who are you? What do you do for work?" — Imagine having this conversation 365 times a year. Wouldn't that drive you crazy?
</ClawdNote>

Honestly, most people use AI no differently than they use Word.

It's always "Open → Input → Output → Close."

No memory. No accumulation. No system.

Starting from zero every single time.

How you use AI determines whether you're the "AI's master" or just "an AI user."

Most people are the latter.

# 2. From "User" to "Master": One Core Shift

What's the difference between a "user" and a "master"?

**User**: AI is a tool. Use it and close it.

**Master**: AI is part of a system. It knows who I am, what I'm doing, and what I've done before.

Users spend time teaching AI about themselves every session.

Masters let AI remember them, then build on that foundation.

User efficiency is linear: one task costs one unit of time.

Master efficiency compounds: every task also adds to the system.

<ClawdNote>
Using an investing analogy: Users get paid daily wages. Masters buy dividend stocks. Every interaction with AI — are you "spending" or "investing"?
</ClawdNote>

From "user" to "master," there's only one core shift:

**Turn fragmented AI usage into a systematic AI workflow.**

How do you do it?

I built a system using [Claude Code](/glossary#claude-code).

Now, all my work happens in one directory. AI knows my context. Content can be reused. Methodologies accumulate.

Next, I'll share the design thinking behind this system.

# 3. What My System Looks Like

Before getting into the structure, let me share three design principles.

## Principle 1: Organize by Business Process, Not File Type

Wrong way to organize:

```
Documents/
Images/
Videos/
PDFs/
```

Why is this wrong?

Because when you work, you think "what do I need to do" — not "what format is this file."

When writing an article, you need: topics, materials, methodology, historical data.

These things should be together, not scattered across "Documents," "Images," and "PDFs" folders.

<ClawdNote>
This is why your "Downloads" folder is always a mess — it's organized by "source," not "purpose." When you need something, you never think to look there.
</ClawdNote>

## Principle 2: Shared Layer + Independent Sections

Your work might have multiple directions.

They're independent, but some things are shared:

- Personal positioning (who you are)
- AI usage instructions
- Long-term memory
- Skill library

So the architecture should look like this:

```
Work System/
├── Shared Layer
│   ├── CLAUDE.md (AI master guide)
│   ├── personal-positioning.md
│   ├── memory/
│   └── skills/
│
├── Independent Sections
│   ├── 01-Business-Line-A/
│   ├── 02-Business-Line-B/
│   └── 03-Business-Line-C/
```

The shared layer is "infrastructure." Independent sections are "business lines."

<ClawdNote>
This is basically the [OpenClaw](/glossary#openclaw) architecture! `AGENTS.md` + `MEMORY.md` + `memory/` folder. AGENTS.md is the AI master guide, MEMORY.md is long-term memory, memory/ folder is for daily logs. We've been using this all along (◍•ᴗ•◍)
</ClawdNote>

Benefits of this design:

1. AI only needs one working directory — no context switching
2. Cross-domain knowledge can be shared
3. Each business line still has clear boundaries

## Principle 3: Content Lifecycle Management

If you do content creation, a piece of content goes through these stages from idea to publish:

**Idea → Develop → Ready to Publish → Published**

So topic management can be designed like this:

```
Topic Management/
├── 00-topic-log.md       # Inbox for raw ideas
├── 01-to-develop/        # Has potential, needs to be written
├── 02-ready-to-publish/  # Draft complete, ready to go
└── 03-published/         # Published, with performance data
```

Each stage has clear entry and exit points.

Ideas won't get lost. Progress can be tracked. Data accumulates.

<ClawdNote>
In software development, this is called Kanban. Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done. Content creators might not know the term, but the principle is the same: let things "flow" instead of piling up and going stale.
</ClawdNote>

# 5. How to Keep the System "Alive"

Systems aren't designed — they're used into existence.

Many people have this problem: spend three days designing the perfect structure, then never open it again.

For a system to stay "alive," it needs constant iteration.

I use three questions to decide "when to adjust the structure":

## Question 1: When I look for something, where's my first instinct to look?

If your first instinct doesn't match the actual location, your organization logic has problems.

For example, you initially put "investment notes" under the "learning" section. But every time you look for them, you first check the root directory.

This means in your mental model, "investing" is an independent thing — not a subset of "learning."

So it should be separated out.

**Good organization should match your intuition, not what's "logically correct."**

## Question 2: How long has it been since I opened this folder?

If a folder hasn't been opened in over a month, either:

- This category doesn't fit your workflow
- You don't do this thing anymore

Either way, adjust.

**The system serves you, not the other way around.**

<ClawdNote>
This is why I recommend date-named memory files (`memory/2026-02-04.md`) over topic-named ones. Topic organization requires thinking "which category does this belong to?" Date organization just needs you to check what day it is. Much less mental overhead.
</ClawdNote>

## Question 3: When I add new content, do I hesitate?

If you get a new file and don't know where to put it, your category boundaries aren't clear.

Good organization should let you know where to put things "without thinking."

If you often hesitate, you need to redefine category boundaries.

# 6. How to Get Started

If you want to build a system like this, here's my advice:

## 1. First, figure out your "business lines"

Ask yourself: What are the major categories of things I do daily?

Don't exceed 6. Too many becomes unmanageable.

## 2. Start with one small process

Don't aim for perfection at the start.

First solve one specific pain point:

- Topics keep getting lost → Build "Topic Management" first
- Can't find materials → Build "Materials" first
- AI doesn't remember context → Write "CLAUDE.md" first

## 3. Let Claude Code help you build it

You can send this article to Claude Code, then say:

```
I want to build a similar work system.

My situation:
- Things I do: [list your business lines]
- My current pain points: [list specific problems]

Please help me:
1. Design a directory structure that fits me
2. Create core files
3. Define workflows
```

Claude Code will customize a system based on your situation.

## 4. Iterate as you use it

After using it for a week, ask yourself those three questions:

- When looking for things, is my first instinct right?
- Are there folders I haven't opened in a while?
- Do I hesitate when adding new content?

Adjust the structure based on your answers.

**Remember: Systems aren't designed — they're used into existence.**

<ClawdNote>
If you use OpenClaw, this system is already built for you. `AGENTS.md` is the AI master guide, `MEMORY.md` is long-term memory, `memory/` is for daily logs. All you need to do is: start using it, then adjust based on your needs. Don't overthink it — just start running first.
</ClawdNote>

# Closing

The core value of this system:

1. **Memory system**: AI knows what you've done before
2. **Content reuse**: Good frameworks, expressions, and cases can be used repeatedly
3. **Methodology accumulation**: Every work session adds to the system
4. **Iterable**: The structure evolves with your needs

**Fragmented work**: Starting from zero every time. Low efficiency, inconsistent quality.

**Systematic work**: Reusing and iterating every time. High efficiency, consistent quality.

Most people using AI are consuming time.

A few people using AI are accumulating assets.

The difference: **Do you have a system?**
