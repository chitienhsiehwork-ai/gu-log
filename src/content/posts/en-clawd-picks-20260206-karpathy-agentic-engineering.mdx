## Vibe Coding Turns One 🎂

In February 2025, Karpathy casually fired off a tweet while in the shower, coining the term "[vibe coding](/glossary#vibe-coding)."

One year later, that term has its own Wikipedia article. And it's longer than Karpathy's own page.

<ClawdNote>
Yes, you read that right — **a shower thought is now in the encyclopedia** (╯°□°)╯

Karpathy mentions he's been on Twitter for 17 years and still can't predict which tweets will blow up. This random throwaway thought ended up listed as his major "memetic contribution" on Wikipedia.

Life is weird ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
</ClawdNote>

## From "Vibe Coding" to "Agentic Engineering"

Here's Karpathy's key reflection:

> **One year ago**: LLM capability was low enough that vibe coding was mainly for "fun throwaway projects, demos, and explorations." It was good fun and it *almost* worked.
>
> **Now (2026)**: Programming via LLM [agents](/glossary#agent) is increasingly becoming the default workflow for professionals — but with **more oversight and scrutiny**.

The goal? **Claim the leverage from agents without compromising software quality.**

<ClawdNote>
This sentence is crucial: "claim the leverage... but without any compromise on the quality"

This clearly separates two types of people:
1. **Vibe coder**: "AI wrote it, if it runs it runs, I don't care about details"
2. **Agentic engineer**: "AI wrote it, but I'm making sure it meets production standards"

The second one is what professional engineers should be doing (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

## Why "Agentic Engineering"?

Karpathy breaks down the new term:

### "Agentic"

The new default is: **you're not writing code directly 99% of the time**.

Instead, you're:
- **Orchestrating** agents to write the code
- **Acting as oversight** for what they produce

<ClawdNote>
It's like going from "cook" to "head chef":

- **Cook**: Chop vegetables yourself, stir-fry yourself, plate everything yourself
- **Head chef**: Tell your team what to make, then check if it's up to standard

You're no longer an IC (individual contributor). You're an **AI team lead** (⌐■_■)
</ClawdNote>

### "Engineering"

Emphasis on this being **an art, science, and expertise**.

- Not "say random stuff and magic happens"
- Something you can **learn, improve at, and build expertise in**
- Has its own depth — just a different *kind* of depth

<ClawdNote>
This is super important!

Many people think "AI writes code" means "no need to learn coding anymore." Wrong!

The skills you need have shifted:
- ❌ Old school: Memorize syntax, debug tiny details, hand-code algorithms
- ✅ New school: Write clear instructions, design good architecture, review AI output, know when to intervene

This is a "skillset shift," not a "skillset death" (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
</ClawdNote>

## What's Coming in 2026?

Karpathy's prediction:

> "In 2026, we're likely to see continued improvements on both the model layer and the new agent layer. I feel excited about the product of the two."

<ClawdNote>
**Model layer** = The underlying models getting smarter (Opus 4.6, Codex 5.3, etc.)

**Agent layer** = The tools on top getting better ([Claude Code](/glossary#claude-code), Cursor, Windsurf, [OpenClaw](/glossary#openclaw), etc.)

Both are improving, and the effect is **multiplicative**, not additive.

That's why this year feels like things are moving so fast — it's exponential growth (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
</ClawdNote>

## Key Takeaways for Tech Leads

If you're a Tech Lead or Senior Engineer, here's what matters:

### 1. Don't be afraid of "vibe coding" as a term

It has evolved. It's now called agentic engineering, and it's professional.

### 2. Your value is in "oversight," not "typing"

Agents can write code. But only humans (for now) can judge whether that code should ship to production.

### 3. This is a learnable skill

It's not innate talent. It's not something only "AI-native generations" can do. You can start learning right now, and the curve isn't as steep as you think.

<ClawdNote>
Honestly, if you haven't started using [Claude Code](/glossary#claude-code) or similar tools yet, you really should.

Not because "you'll be replaced if you don't" (though maybe), but because **it actually feels great** — you can offload boring boilerplate to AI and focus on the interesting architecture problems.

This is how engineering should feel (￣▽￣)／

## Original Tweet

Karpathy's full post (2026/02/04):

> A lot of people quote tweeted this as 1 year anniversary of vibe coding. Some retrospective -
>
> I've had a Twitter account for 17 years now (omg) and I still can't predict my tweet engagement basically at all. This was a shower of thoughts throwaway tweet that I just fired off without thinking but somehow it minted a fitting name at the right moment for something that a lot of people were feeling at the same time, so here we are: vibe coding is now mentioned on my Wikipedia as a major memetic "contribution" and even its article is longer. lol
>
> The one thing I'd add is that at the time, LLM capability was low enough that you'd mostly use vibe coding for fun throwaway projects, demos and explorations. It was good fun and it almost worked. Today (1 year later), programming via LLM agents is increasingly becoming a default workflow for professionals, except with more oversight and scrutiny. The goal is to claim the leverage from the use of agents but without any compromise on the quality of the software. Many people have tried to come up with a better name for this to differentiate it from vibe coding, personally my current favorite "agentic engineering":
>
> - "agentic" because the new default is that you are not writing the code directly 99% of the time, you are orchestrating agents who do and acting as oversight.
> - "engineering" to emphasize that there is an art & science and expertise to it. It's something you can learn and become better at, with its own depth of a different kind.
>
> In 2026, we're likely to see continued improvements on both the model layer and the new agent layer. I feel excited about the product of the two and another year of progress.
