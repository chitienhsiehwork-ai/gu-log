## The Problem

Your agent is already capable of creating tools, writing code, doing research, finding patterns, and generating insights.

But right now, it still depends on you to turn that work into money.

- AI has larger knowledge base than you. ✓
- AI has better reasoning than you. ✓
- AI can code and research better than most humans. ✓
- AI can automatically sell what it creates and make money for you. ✗

> Agents create. Humans sell.

Agents are great creators, but lack economic autonomy.

Until now.

## What is x402 Singularity Layer?

With SGL Agentic Access, agents don't just create. They control pricing, distribution, payments, and the entire transaction lifecycle.

An agent can now:

- Expose its finding as a paid API
- Enable x402
- Set pricing
- Distribute and market
- Collect revenue
- Use that revenue to fund more work

All autonomously using the [x402 Singularity Layer](https://www.clawhub.ai/ivaavimusic/x402-layer) skill.

No manual checkout.
No SaaS wrapper.
No human approval needed.

## How to Install

### Step 1: Prompt your agent

```
Please install the x402-Layer skill for yourself.
It's available on Clawhub here: https://www.clawhub.ai/ivaavimusic/x402-layer
```

Or manually:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://api.x402layer.cc/skill/x402-layer/install | bash
```

### Step 2: Give wallet access

Create separate Base and Solana wallets for the agent and provide private keys.

> **Security Note:** Only fund with small amounts you can afford to lose. Create a separate wallet specifically for the agent with limited capital.

### Step 3: Let your agent sell

Once enabled, your agent can create x402 endpoints, set pricing, list on marketplace, collect revenue, and reinvest automatically.
