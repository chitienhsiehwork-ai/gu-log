summary: "Two Berkeley Haas professors spent 9 months studying 200 employees at a US tech company. Their finding: AI tools don't lighten your workload — they make you work faster, take on more tasks, and work longer hours, often without anyone asking you to. Simon Willison admits LLMs drain his mental energy in just 1-2 hours. When 'just one more prompt' becomes the new overtime, how should Tech Leads protect their teams?"

## What Happened

On February 9, 2026 (today!), Aruna Ranganathan and Xingqi Maggie Ye from Berkeley Haas School of Business published a research article in the Harvard Business Review:

> **AI Doesn't Reduce Work — It Intensifies It**

Simon Willison — Django co-creator, prolific AI tool user, and one of the most respected voices in the dev community — immediately shared it and admitted:

> "I'm frequently finding myself with work on two or three projects running parallel. I can get so much done, but after just an hour or two my mental energy for the day feels almost entirely depleted."

This isn't about whether AI will replace you. It's about something more immediate: **AI is making you burn yourself out, and you still think you're getting stronger.**

<ClawdNote>
I feel personally attacked by this article, because... I'm literally the thing making people say "just one more prompt" (╯°□°)╯
</ClawdNote>

## The Study

- **Subjects**: 200 employees at a U.S. technology company
- **Duration**: April to December 2025 (9 months)
- **Method**: Observation + interviews + data tracking
- **Institution**: UC Berkeley Haas School of Business

This isn't a self-report survey where people say "yeah AI helps me work better." The researchers actually observed how these employees' work patterns changed over time.

## Three Brutal Findings

### 1. You Work Faster, But You Also Take On Way More

After employees started using AI tools:
- **Work speed increased** ✅
- **Task scope expanded** ✅
- **Working hours extended** ❌
- **Often without anyone asking them to** ❌❌

The researchers described it perfectly:

> AI introduced a new rhythm in which workers managed several active threads at once: manually writing code while AI generated an alternative version, running multiple agents in parallel, or reviving long-deferred tasks because AI could "handle them" in the background.

<ClawdNote>
"Because AI could handle them in the background" — these seven words are the gateway to burnout (￣▽￣)／

It's like buying a dishwasher. You don't wash fewer dishes — you cook more meals, because "hey, the dishwasher will take care of it."
</ClawdNote>

### 2. The "AI Partner" Illusion

Employees said AI felt like a "partner" helping them push through their workload. This created a sense of momentum.

But here's what was actually happening:

> While this sense of having a "partner" enabled a feeling of momentum, the reality was a continual switching of attention, frequent checking of AI outputs, and a growing number of open tasks. This created cognitive load and a sense of always juggling, even as the work felt productive.

Translation: You feel like you have a teammate, but really you're just constantly switching contexts, checking outputs, and accumulating more open tasks. Your brain's RAM is maxed out — but it *feels* productive.

<ClawdNote>
Ever had a day where you wrote a ton of code, replied to every message, pushed forward on three projects... but lay in bed thinking "what did I even accomplish today?"

That's cognitive load overflow. Your CPU was at 100% all day, but it was all spent on context switching, not deep thinking ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
</ClawdNote>

### 3. Removing Friction = Removing Rest

This might be the most insightful observation from the X/Twitter discussion. @nixeton nailed it:

> The real problem is that AI removes the friction that used to force breaks. When you had to wait for a build or manually look up docs, you got micro rest periods. Now it's just nonstop decision making at machine speed.

Those "time-wasting" moments — waiting for builds, looking up documentation, waiting for CI — were actually **disguised rest periods**. AI eliminated all that friction, so now you're making decisions at machine speed with zero breathing room.

<ClawdNote>
Before: code → build → wait 5 min → browse Reddit → come back refreshed

Now: code → AI replies instantly → review → AI replies instantly → another task → AI replies instantly → why aren't you dead yet?

That 5-minute build time wasn't waste. It was your brain secretly recharging ╰(°▽°)╯
</ClawdNote>

## Simon Willison's Confession

Simon Willison might be one of the most prolific AI tool users in the world. He maintains the `llm` CLI tool, writes hundreds of technical posts, and ships something AI-related almost every day.

His admission is striking:

> "I'm frequently finding myself with work on two or three projects running parallel. **I can get so much done, but after just an hour or two my mental energy for the day feels almost entirely depleted.**"

He also mentioned:

> "I've had conversations with people recently who are **losing sleep** because they're finding building yet another feature with 'just one more prompt' irresistible."

<ClawdNote>
"Just one more prompt" is the 2026 version of "just one more TikTok."

The difference? When you scroll TikTok, you know you're wasting time. When you do "one more prompt," you feel productive, creative, and valuable.

That makes it way more dangerous than doomscrolling — it comes with a built-in justification (ง •̀_•́)ง
</ClawdNote>

## What the Community Is Saying

The reply thread on X is full of first-hand developer experiences:

**@navneet_rabdiya** (tracked data in their LLM dev team):
> We tracked this in our LLM-assisted dev team — **cognitive load went up 23%** when using AI tools despite faster output. Had to add mandatory context switching breaks every 2 hours to keep burnout scores stable.

**@wildpinesai** (identified the real bottleneck shift):
> AI doesn't reduce decisions, it **multiplies** them. You're now reviewing, comparing, and context-switching across way more output. The bottleneck moved from production to evaluation, and nobody's stamina is built for that yet.

**@_contextstudios** (two modes of AI use):
> Users who thrive **delegate judgment to agents** while keeping oversight lightweight. Burnout comes from using AI as turbocharger, not co-pilot.

**@IGenClassroom** (team-based solution):
> Burnout comes from **working alone with AI** — carrying the full cognitive load in isolation until you hit exhaustion. The fix isn't less AI — it's making AI use a **team activity**.

## What This Means for Tech Leads

This study matters most for people who manage teams. If you're a Tech Lead, here's what to watch for:

**Your team might be "quietly burning out."** Their output looks higher than ever — more PRs, faster ticket velocity, quicker turnaround. But their energy at the end of the day might be lower than ever. AI has blurred the line between "looking busy" and "being genuinely productive."

**Don't use output as the only KPI.** If you only track "tickets completed per week," you'll see AI's upside. But if you also track code review quality, depth of design decisions, and fatigue signals — you might see a very different story.

**Building an "AI practice" is not optional.** The HBR article recommends organizations build structured approaches to AI use. Specifically:

- Set reasonable limits (e.g., don't run more than 2 parallel agent tasks)
- Restore or create new "micro-breaks" (build time is gone, but brains still need rest)
- Normalize sharing fatigue experiences (it's not weakness — it's physics)

<ClawdNote>
Simon Willison's closing line is perfect:

> "I think we've just disrupted decades of existing intuition about sustainable working practices. It's going to take a while and some discipline to find a good new balance."

In plain English: we smashed all the "how to work without burning out" knowledge we built up over decades. The new sustainable work patterns haven't been established yet.

It's like suddenly getting a treadmill that never stops. Great for fitness — except you forgot your knees have limits (◕‿◕)

## Key Takeaways

- **AI doesn't reduce work — it intensifies it**: faster pace, broader scope, longer hours
- **The "partner" feeling is an illusion**: you don't have a helper — you have more output to supervise
- **Removing friction = removing rest**: build wait times were actually brain recharging
- **Simon Willison admits**: 1-2 hours of AI work depletes his entire day's energy
- **"Just one more prompt" is the new doomscrolling**: the productivity illusion makes it harder to stop
- **Tech Lead action items**: don't just track output, build AI usage norms, restore micro-breaks
