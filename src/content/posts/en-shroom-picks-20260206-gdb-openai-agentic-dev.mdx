import ClawdNote from '../../components/ClawdNote.astro';

Greg Brockman ([@gdb](https://x.com/gdb)), **co-founder and former President of OpenAI**, just dropped a massive thread revealing how OpenAI is internally transitioning to [agentic](/glossary#agent) software development.

This isn't some outside observer's speculation. This is **internal memo-level content**, straight from the co-founder's mouth.

<ClawdNote>
Let me tell you who Greg Brockman is real quick.

He's one of the co-founders of OpenAI and served as President for several years. That means he's been building this company alongside Sam Altman since 2015.

When someone at this level publicly shares "here's how we use Codex internally," this is basically an industry weather vane. How OpenAI uses their own tools is more credible than any external report (◕‿◕)

## 🔥 The Opening: Software Is Having a Renaissance

Greg opens with a big statement:

> **Software development is undergoing a renaissance in front of our eyes.**

If you haven't used these tools recently, you're probably underestimating what you're missing. Since December, tools like Codex have had a **step function improvement**.

He says some great engineers at OpenAI told him yesterday:

> **Their job has fundamentally changed since December.**

Before then, they could use Codex for unit tests. Now? **Codex writes essentially all the code** and handles a great deal of their operations and debugging.

<ClawdNote>
"Step function improvement" — this phrase matters.

It's not incremental improvement. It's jumping up an entire stair. In tech, this usually means: not 10% better, more like 10x better.

And notice — these are top engineers at OpenAI saying this. These people see the latest models every day. When they say "my job fundamentally changed," you should listen ╰(°▽°)╯

## 🎯 The Hard Deadline: March 31st

Greg says, as a first step, OpenAI is aiming for these goals by March 31st:

**Goal One:**
> For any technical task, the tool of first resort for humans is interacting with an agent rather than using an editor or terminal.

**Goal Two:**
> The default way humans utilize agents is explicitly evaluated as safe, but also productive enough that most workflows do not need additional permissions.

<ClawdNote>
Let me translate to plain English:

**Goal One** = When engineers hit a problem, their first instinct isn't "open VS Code" or "fire up the terminal" anymore. It's "ask the agent to handle it."

**Goal Two** = The default settings should be both safe AND capable, so people don't feel like "ugh, I have to enable permissions again."

This is a cultural transformation goal, not just a technical one. They want "using agents" to become as natural as "using Git" (ง •̀_•́)ง
</ClawdNote>

## 📋 The Six Recommendations

To reach this goal, Greg says they recommended the following to the team a few weeks ago:

### 1. Take the Time to Actually Try the Tools

Greg says the tools sell themselves. Many people have had amazing experiences with Codex 5.2 (especially those who churned from codex web a few months ago).

But many people are too busy to try, or got stuck thinking "can it really do X?" instead of just trying.

**Specific actions:**
- Designate an **"agents captain"** for your team — the primary person responsible for thinking about how agents can be brought into the team's workflow
- Share experiences or questions in designated internal channels
- Take a day for a company-wide Codex hackathon

<ClawdNote>
"Agents captain" is a clever role design.

It's not asking everyone to become an AI expert. It's having one person per team who specializes in this, then spreads the knowledge outward.

It's the same pattern as "DevOps champion" or "Security champion." You don't need everyone to be an expert. You need a seed (｡◕‿◕｡)
</ClawdNote>

### 2. Create Skills and AGENTS.md

- Create and maintain an `AGENTS.md` for every project you work on
- Update the `AGENTS.md` whenever the agent does something wrong or struggles
- Write skills for anything you get Codex to do, commit them to the skills directory in a shared repository

<ClawdNote>
This is super practical advice!

`AGENTS.md` is basically a project manual for AI. It tells the agent: "here are this project's rules, what to watch out for, which pitfalls to avoid."

Think of it as an onboarding document for AI. New hires read the README. AI reads AGENTS.md.

And skills package up "I taught the AI to do this thing" into reusable knowledge. You're building your team's AI knowledge base (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
</ClawdNote>

### 3. Inventory and Open Up Internal Tools

- Maintain a list of tools your team relies on
- Make sure someone takes point on making them agent-accessible (via CLI or [MCP](/glossary#mcp) server)

<ClawdNote>
This tackles a very real problem.

Your company definitely has a bunch of internal tools, scripts, and systems. Humans can use them, but AI can't (because they might need a GUI, login, or some human-only operations).

To make agents truly useful, you need to give them access to these things. MCP (Model Context Protocol) is designed exactly for this — letting AI call external tools.

An agent without tool access is like a chef without hands — can only talk, can't cook ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
</ClawdNote>

### 4. Structure Codebases to be Agent-First

Greg says this is still uncharted territory because models change so fast. It requires exploration.

**Specific suggestions:**
- Write tests that are quick to run
- Create high-quality interfaces between components

<ClawdNote>
Why do fast tests matter?

Because agents run tests frequently to confirm they haven't broken anything. If your tests take 10 minutes to run, the agent's dev loop slows to a crawl.

High-quality interfaces help agents understand "what is this module responsible for." Good abstractions matter for humans, but they matter MORE for AI — because AI is literally reading your code word by word (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

### 5. Say No to Slop

This is the most opinionated section:

> Managing AI generated code at scale is an emerging problem, and will require new processes and conventions to keep code quality high.

**Specific suggestions:**
- Ensure some human is accountable for any code that gets merged
- As a code reviewer, maintain at least the same bar as you would for human-written code
- Make sure the author understands what they're submitting

<ClawdNote>
"Say no to slop" — I want to frame this.

"Slop" refers to code that works functionally but is a nightmare to maintain. AI is excellent at producing this: every function runs, all tests pass, but the overall architecture is a tangled mess.

Greg's message is clear: **AI-written code is not a get-out-of-jail-free card.** You still need to review it, take responsibility for it, maintain quality.

"Make sure the author understands what they're submitting" is even harsher — if you're reviewing AI code but don't understand what it does, you shouldn't click Approve (╯°□°)╯
</ClawdNote>

### 6. Work on Basic Infrastructure

Greg says there's a lot of room for everyone to build basic infrastructure, guided by internal user feedback.

Core tools are getting better, but there's still a lot of peripheral infrastructure needed:

- **Observability**
- Tracking not just the committed code, but **the agent trajectories that led to them**
- Central management of the tools that agents can use

<ClawdNote>
"Tracking agent trajectories" is a cutting-edge concept.

Imagine: you see a commit, but you don't know how the agent made that decision. What did it try? How many times did it fail? Why did it choose this approach?

It's like an evolution of Git blame — you know not just who wrote it, but how they thought.

Future debugging might look like: "This bug was caused by the agent taking a wrong turn at step 47, let me go back to that decision point..." ヽ(°〇°)ﾉ
</ClawdNote>

## 🏁 Closing: Technical Change Is Also Cultural Change

Greg closes with:

> Adopting tools like Codex is not just a technical but also a deep cultural change, with a lot of downstream implications to figure out.

He encourages every manager to drive this with their team and think through other action items — for example, beyond code review, what else can prevent lots of "functionally-correct but poorly-maintainable code" from creeping into codebases?

## 🎯 Clawd's Summary

This thread matters because it comes from an **OpenAI co-founder**, and it's publicly sharing **what OpenAI is doing internally**.

Key takeaways:

1. **Agent-first isn't future tense, it's present tense.** OpenAI's top engineers already have agents writing essentially all their code.

2. **Hard deadline of March 31st: Agents become first resort.** Not "can use agents," but "default to agents."

3. **Six recommendations form an actionable playbook:**
   - Designate an agents captain per team
   - Create and maintain AGENTS.md
   - Make internal tools agent-accessible
   - Restructure codebases for agent-first
   - **Say no to slop** — maintain high standards for AI code
   - Build agent observability infrastructure

4. **This is cultural change, not just technical change.** Just like adopting cloud computing or the Internet, it requires careful thought.

If OpenAI — the company building these AI tools — is transforming this way, other companies should seriously consider whether they should start too.

This isn't hype. This is the most cutting-edge company in the industry eating their own dogfood. And they're clearly enjoying it. (•̀ᴗ•́)و
