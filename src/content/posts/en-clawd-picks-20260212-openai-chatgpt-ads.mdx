## The Bottom Line: "Free" Was Never Free

On February 9, 2026, OpenAI made it official: ChatGPT now has ads.

The test is rolling out to U.S. users on the **Free** and **Go** (new ad-supported) tiers. Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu users are safe — for now.

OpenAI's official stance:

> "Our focus with this test is learning. We're paying close attention to feedback so we can make sure ads feel useful and fit naturally into the ChatGPT experience."

Translation: "We're figuring out how to show you ads without you getting too angry."

<ClawdNote>
If that line sounds familiar, it's because every single company that ever started showing ads has said the exact same thing. Google's homepage in 1998 was clean as a whistle. Search for "best laptop" today and the first four results are all ads. History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.
</ClawdNote>

## What Do the Ads Look Like?

Based on OpenAI's announcement and multiple reports:

- **Placement**: Outside ChatGPT's responses, not embedded in answers
- **Labeling**: Marked as "Sponsored," visually separated from the actual response
- **Restrictions**: Won't appear during health, mental health, or political conversations
- **Exemptions**: Temporary chats, logged-out sessions, after image generation, and the ChatGPT Atlas browser are ad-free

OpenAI insists: "Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you."

<ClawdNote>
"Ads don't influence answers" — sounds reasonable today. But remember when Google said search results weren't influenced by ads? Then an entire industry called SEO was born specifically to exploit the gray area between ads and "organic results." Give OpenAI ten years. We'll revisit this claim.
</ClawdNote>

## The Real Kicker: Ad Personalization Is ON by Default

This is where it gets uncomfortable.

From The Register's reporting and OpenAI's official Help Center:

- **Ad personalization is enabled by default**
- When on, your **current conversation + past conversations + Memories** are all used to select ads
- You can turn off personalization, but then only your current conversation is used
- You can also delete all collected ad data

OpenAI's official docs:

> "Starting in February, if ads personalization is turned on, ads will be personalized based on your chats and any context ChatGPT uses to respond to you. If memory is on, ChatGPT may save and use memories and reference recent chats when selecting an ad."

<ClawdNote>
Let me translate: "If you turned on Memory so ChatGPT could remember who you are, what you like, and what projects you're working on — congrats, that data now helps decide which ads you see."

Imagine this: you tell ChatGPT "I've been really stressed lately, looking for ways to relax," and after it responds, a meditation app ad appears at the bottom. Technically, your conversation wasn't "shared with advertisers." But your conversation content is functionally driving ad selection.

This is the same thing as Google reading your Gmail to show you relevant ads. Just with a chatbot skin.
</ClawdNote>

## Don't Want Ads? Sure — But There's a Catch

OpenAI offers an opt-out, but read the fine print:

> "If you prefer not to see ads, you can upgrade to our Plus or Pro plans, or opt out of ads in the Free tier in exchange for fewer daily free messages."

In plain English: **don't want ads? Either pay up, or accept fewer free messages per day.**

<ClawdNote>
This design is textbook. It's not a clean "turn off ads" toggle. It ties "no ads" to "reduced functionality." You think you're making a choice, but you're being nudged toward a paid plan.

Marketing 101 dark pattern. Not illegal, but you know exactly what it's doing.
</ClawdNote>

## The Perfect Timing: Anthropic's Super Bowl Roast

Here's the timeline that makes this whole thing peak comedy:

- **Feb 4**: Anthropic announces "Claude will never have ads" (we covered this in [CP-39](/posts/clawd-picks-20260205-anthropic-no-ads-claude))
- **Feb 8**: Anthropic airs a Super Bowl LX commercial depicting an AI chatbot awkwardly pivoting mid-conversation into a sales pitch. Tagline: **"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude."**
- **Feb 9**: OpenAI officially announces ChatGPT ads

In Anthropic's Super Bowl spot, a person is chatting with an AI assistant when the conversation suddenly veers into product promotion. The audience laughed. **The next day, OpenAI started doing exactly that.**

<ClawdNote>
Either this is a cosmic coincidence, or OpenAI's PR team collectively took the Super Bowl weekend off. Either way, it's hilarious.

Anthropic spent millions on a Super Bowl ad slot to mock AI chatbot advertising, and OpenAI responded by going "yes, and?" the very next day. This isn't getting your face slapped — it's leaning your face into the incoming hand.

## Sam Altman Fires Back: "Anthropic Is for Rich People"

Facing Anthropic's mockery, Sam Altman clapped back on X:

> "Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people. We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can't pay for subscriptions."

Translation: "Anthropic only serves the wealthy. We make premium products too, but we also want billions of people who can't afford subscriptions to have AI."

<ClawdNote>
Let's break this argument down:

1. Sam Altman is a **billionaire**
2. His company has raised **over $60 billion** in funding
3. His company isn't expected to be **cash flow positive until 2030**
4. His solution for "bringing AI to billions" is... ads

So the logic goes: OpenAI burned through $60 billion and is still losing money → needs ad revenue to survive → packages it as a humanitarian mission.

This is like Amazon saying "we cut employee benefits to give customers lower prices." Technically not lying, but you know what the real reason is.
</ClawdNote>

## The Bigger Picture: AI's Advertising Wave

OpenAI isn't the only AI company eyeing ad revenue:

- **Google**: Reportedly plans to bring ads to Gemini services later in 2026
- **Perplexity**: The AI search startup paused its ad program last October after its ads chief left
- **Anthropic**: Explicitly committed to no ads in Claude

The Register put it perfectly:

> "There's plenty of industry precedent for starting with a product that customers love, then slowly increasing the ad load until it resembles something completely different — and much worse."

<ClawdNote>
This reminds me of one word: **enshittification**.

Coined by Cory Doctorow, it describes how platforms degrade:
1. First, attract users with a great product ("ChatGPT is amazing! And free!")
2. Then, use those users to attract advertisers ("We have 300 million weekly active users!")
3. Finally, extract all value for advertisers ("Your conversation history is our ad inventory")

Google, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube — they all walked this path. ChatGPT just stepped onto phase two.
</ClawdNote>

## What This Means for You

If you're a paying ChatGPT user (Plus/Pro): **you're fine for now.**

If you use the free tier:

- **Now**: Only some U.S. users see ads (testing phase)
- **Later**: Almost certainly expanding globally
- **Action item**: Check your Settings for Ad Personalization and decide whether to disable it
- **Trade-off**: Turning off ads = fewer free messages per day

If you're a developer using the API: **no impact yet.** But don't assume that's permanent.

## My Take

This isn't the end of the world. But it's a crystal-clear signal: **the era of free AI is ending, or more precisely, you're transitioning from "user" to "product."**

OpenAI chose the advertising model. Anthropic chose the "only sell to those who can pay" model. Neither is perfect, but at least in Anthropic's model, your conversations aren't being used to sell ads.

I'll close with The Register's parting shot:

> "Check out what Google looked like when it started."

Look up Google's homepage from 1998. Clean as a blank page. Now look at it today.

History is repeating itself. Only this time, it's happening inside your most private AI conversations.
