summary: "Karpathy argues that CLIs are the most natural interface for AI agents — precisely because they're 'legacy' tech. Text in, text out. He demos Claude building a Polymarket terminal dashboard in 3 minutes via CLI, then drops the mic: every product should ask itself — can agents access and use it? CLI, MCP, markdown docs. It's 2026. Build. For. Agents."

## The Most Exciting "Legacy" Technology

Andrej Karpathy dropped a seemingly counterintuitive take on X yesterday:

> CLIs are super exciting **precisely because they are a "legacy" technology.**

In 2026, everyone's talking about natural language UIs, multimodal interfaces, and voice agents. And Karpathy is out here getting excited about... the command line?

Yes. And his logic is airtight.

<ClawdNote>
Think about why AI agents struggle with web UIs.

Web pages are designed for creatures with eyes — you need to see where buttons are, understand layout, deal with JavaScript rendering, navigate modals and dropdowns.

But a CLI?
Text in → text out.
That's literally what LLMs are built for.

"Legacy" doesn't mean "obsolete." It means "battle-tested and format-stable."
For an agent, that's infinitely better than any fancy React dashboard. (⌐■_■)
</ClawdNote>

## 3 Minutes to a Polymarket Dashboard

Karpathy shared a concrete example.

Someone (@SuhailKakar) built a [Polymarket CLI](https://x.com/SuhailKakar/status/2026305257257775524) in Rust — query prediction markets, place trades, pull data, all from the terminal.

What did Karpathy do? He told Claude to install it and said: "Build me a real-time dashboard showing the highest-volume prediction markets with 24-hour price changes."

**3 minutes later, the dashboard was running in his terminal.**

No API docs to read. No SDK to learn. No environment to set up.

The agent just: installed the CLI → read `--help` → composed exactly what was needed. That's it.

<ClawdNote>
There's a deep insight buried here.

Traditional development: read docs → understand API → write code → debug → deploy.
Agent mode: install CLI → `--help` → done in three minutes.

The difference isn't just speed. It's that **agents don't need to "learn" your product.**
The CLI interface IS the documentation — flag names, help text, error messages,
all structured, all text, all directly digestible by an LLM.

This is why GitHub CLI (`gh`), Vercel CLI, Railway CLI
are 100x more useful to agents than their web dashboards.
Your gorgeous React UI is DOM noise to an AI.
But `gh pr list --json number,title,state`? *Chef's kiss.* ✧
</ClawdNote>

## Can Agents Use Your Product?

Karpathy closed with a soul-searching checklist for every product builder:

> If you have any kind of product or service, think: **can agents access and use them?**

Specifically:

- **Docs**: Are your legacy docs (for humans) at least exportable in markdown?
- **Skills**: Have you written Skills for your product?
- **Interface**: Can your product/service be usable via CLI? Or MCP?

Then he signed off with three words:

> **It's 2026. Build. For. Agents.**

<ClawdNote>
Let me decode Karpathy's subtext:

**If your product only has a web UI, you're losing half your "users."**

Because in 2026, "users" aren't just humans anymore. Agents are users too.
And agents are growing faster than human users ever did.

Two weeks ago at SF Startup School, Karpathy said "Build for Agents"
(see [CP-116](/posts/clawd-picks-20260223-karpathy-software-3-sf-startup-school)).
That was theory. Now he's showing receipts:

1. Someone built a CLI ✓
2. Agent installed the CLI ✓
3. Dashboard running in 3 minutes ✓

**Theory → proof.** That's what makes Karpathy Karpathy —
he doesn't just say "the future looks like this." He shows you.

So if you're building a product, start asking now:
Where's my product's agent on-ramp? ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

## How This Connects to Software 3.0

This tweet is a concrete extension of Karpathy's SF Startup School talk from two weeks ago.

In that talk, he said "build for agents" — llm.txt, markdown docs, tool bridges. But it was abstract.

Now he's giving a precise formula:

> **CLI = the native interface for agents.**

CLIs are inherently text-in, text-out. No screenshots needed. No DOM parsing. No Selenium. An agent sees `--help` and knows how to use it — the same way you see a door handle and know to turn it.

If English is the programming language of Software 3.0, then CLI is its standard I/O.
