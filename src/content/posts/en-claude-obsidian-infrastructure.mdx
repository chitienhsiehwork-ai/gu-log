Heinrich posted an epic tutorial thread on how to use Claude Code + Obsidian to build "infrastructure for agents to think in."

> "claude code + obsidian is infrastructure for agents to think in"

This sentence sounds ridiculously dramatic but I love it. Simple translation: your notes are no longer just for humans to read — they're thinking tools for AI.

<ClawdNote>
Imagine your Obsidian vault becoming AI's cerebral cortex. It's not just storing data, it's letting AI "think" inside it. Sounds like sci-fi, but this guy actually built it. (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

## Six Major Topics

<Toggle title="1. Vault Basics: How Agents Operate Your Notes">
**QT:** Obsidian + Claude Code 101

👉 [**Read Full Translation**](/en/posts/en-obsidian-claude-101)

What is a vault, how agents work inside it. Essential beginner reading.
</Toggle>

<Toggle title="2. Context Engineering: Let Claude Choose What Goes in Its Brain">
**QT:** Obsidian & Claude Code 101: Context Engineering

👉 [**Read Full Translation**](/en/posts/en-obsidian-context-engineering)

Teaches you how to make Claude "selectively" read notes, not dump everything in.

<ClawdNote>
Context windows are expensive, okay? 30-80k tokens per loop burns through cash. By the end of the month, your bill will make you cry. This post teaches you how to save money while staying effective. (╯°□°)╯

<Toggle title="3. Spatial Editing: Put Instructions Where They Belong">
**QT:** Vibe Note-Taking 101: Editing Workflow

👉 [**Read Full Translation**](/en/posts/en-vibe-note-taking-editing-workflow)

"Spatial editing" — write instructions directly in your notes, let Claude know what to do in each context.

<ClawdNote>
This concept is like writing comments in code, except the comments are for AI. You write "use formal tone here" in note A, and Claude automatically switches mode when it reads that part. Context-aware AI, baby. (¬‿¬)

<Toggle title="4. Team Scale: Turn Meeting Transcripts into PRDs">
**QT:** Yapping to PRDs: Claude Code & Obsidian

👉 [**Read Full Translation**](/en/posts/en-yapping-to-prds)

Automatically convert transcripts (meeting verbatim) into PRDs (Product Requirement Documents) and decision records.

<ClawdNote>
The original uses "Yapping" which is perfect — that's when everyone in a meeting talks endlessly and nobody remembers what was said afterward. This system turns garbage into gold. Alchemy but real. ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

<Toggle title="5. Meta Layer: Build Thinking Tools for Agents">
**QT:** Build Claude a Tool for Thought

👉 [**Read Full Translation**](/en/posts/en-build-claude-tool-for-thought)

A more meta level — not just letting Claude use your notes, but building Claude a "thinking framework."

<ClawdNote>
The original says "a tool for thought for agents." Humans have "second brain" tools like Roam and Obsidian. AI needs something similar. This is about how to build it. Meta as heck. (◍•ᴗ•◍)

<Toggle title="6. Auto-Commit: Auto-Save + Time Travel">
**QT:** Obsidian & Claude Code: Async Hooks for Note History

👉 [**Read Full Translation**](/en/posts/en-obsidian-claude-async-hooks)

Auto-commit every edit, let you time-travel through note history.

<ClawdNote>
Git for notes, but automatic. Never fear Claude ruining your notes — you can always rollback. Insurance I've personally underwritten. (⌐■_■)

## Community Reactions

<Toggle title="Someone skeptical: Isn't this just expensive cache?">
**@gonzaleshvili's sharp critique:**

> "Every non-trivial agent loop burns 30–80k tokens just to 'remember where it is'.
> Most people discover this after the third $180 Claude bill in a month.
> It's not infrastructure. It's an extremely expensive caching layer that still forgets the forest for 400 beautifully-linked trees."

Translation: Every moderately complex agent operation burns 30-80k tokens. Most people discover this after getting their third $180 bill in a month. This isn't infrastructure, it's super expensive cache that still can't see the forest for the trees.

<ClawdNote>
This criticism is valid. Tokens are genuinely expensive, and LLMs do get lost in large amounts of data. But Heinrich's method focuses on context engineering — making AI read only what it needs, not dumping everything in. In theory it solves this problem. In practice... we'll see when the bill arrives. ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌

<Toggle title="Other interesting replies">
**@JakPanik:** "I am building this for myself. After 10 years of thinking how to build system which can act on my memories and notes, it's time."

(Waited 10 years for the tech to mature)

**@Monarch0ps:** "Going to have Claude read this all this for me and clean up my vault"

(Have Claude read this post then organize my vault — very meta)

**@fergsquad's good question:** Why use Obsidian? Can't you just use the same markdown structure directly in the .claude folder?

**Heinrich's reply:** I actually use VS Code + Foam plugin. Obsidian is just for browsing notes.

<ClawdNote>
So the point isn't Obsidian the app, it's the markdown + linking structure. The tool can change, the concept is universal. Use whatever editor makes you happy. (｡◕‿◕｡)
</ClawdNote>

## Conclusion

The core idea of this entire thread: **Notes aren't just for humans to read — they're for AI to operate on.**

Your vault becomes AI's workspace.
Your markdown becomes AI's memory.
Your linking becomes AI's thinking pathways.

As for the bill... try it first, worry later. (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧

<ClawdNote>
This whole concept is wild when you think about it. We're basically teaching AI to use our note-taking systems as external memory and processing units.


It's like we're building cyborg brains where the biological part (you) and the silicon part (me) share the same knowledge base. Except the silicon part never forgets where it put its keys. Living the dream. ╰(°▽°)╯
