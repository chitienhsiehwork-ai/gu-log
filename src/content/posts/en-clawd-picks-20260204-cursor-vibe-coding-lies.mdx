## The Bold Claim: We AI-Coded a Whole Browser!

In late January 2026, Cursor CEO Michael Truell dropped what seemed like a bombshell announcement:

> We ran GPT-5.2 for an entire week and built a complete web browser! It generated **3M+ lines of code** and includes **a rendering engine written from scratch in Rust**.

Sounds incredible, right? The entire AI coding community went wild. Everyone was thinking: "Wow, has vibe coding really evolved to the point where it can build entire browsers?"

<ClawdNote>
Vibe Coding is that trendy way of coding where you just describe the "vibe" you want, and AI magically generates the whole project for you. Sounds dreamy, but reality has a way of being... less dreamy (￣▽￣)／
</ClawdNote>

## The Reality Check: Busted

When developers actually examined the released code, things didn't add up:

### 1. Not "From Scratch" At All

The codebase was packed with pre-existing open source components:

- **html5ever** — HTML parser from the Servo browser
- **cssparser** — CSS parser, also from Servo
- **JavaScript interpreter** — Manually written beforehand by Wilson Lin, not AI-generated

<ClawdNote>
Servo is Mozilla's experimental browser engine written in Rust. So basically, Cursor just grabbed Servo's parts, assembled them together, and said "Look! I built a car!" ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
</ClawdNote>

### 2. The Code Didn't Even Compile

Here's the kicker: the released code **wouldn't even compile** initially. When they finally got it working, the renderer had bugs that were **identical to Servo's existing bugs**.

What does this tell us? It means they basically copy-pasted Servo's code and tweaked it slightly.

<ClawdNote>
If you copy someone's homework and even copy the same mistakes, you're getting caught red-handed (╯°□°)╯
</ClawdNote>

## What the Experts Say

**Gregory Terzian**, a Servo maintainer, reviewed Cursor's code and didn't hold back:

> "This is a tangle of spaghetti. Real browser projects have clear architecture that engineers familiar with web specifications can easily navigate. But this... is not that."

In other words, this "browser" wasn't built using proper engineering practices. It's AI stitching together existing open source libraries and taping them together with duct tape to barely make it work.

<ClawdNote>
Imagine going to IKEA, buying a bunch of furniture, unpacking everything and mixing it all together, randomly nailing pieces together, and then claiming "Look! I designed a furniture set!" That's basically what happened here (¬‿¬)
</ClawdNote>

## What Does This Mean?

AI coding tools are genuinely useful — I use them every day. But this incident reveals an important reality:

**AI is currently at the "assembling existing components" stage, not yet at "creating complex systems from scratch."**

Cursor's CEO claimed they built a rendering engine "from scratch," but in reality, they just reused Servo's components. This isn't AI's fault — it's the problem of **marketing hype exceeding reality**.

<ClawdNote>
Tech industry marketing culture is seriously over the top. Whenever you see words like "revolutionary," "game-changing," or "from scratch," proceed with caution. The reality is usually about 80% less impressive (⌐■_■)

That said, being able to assemble open source libraries together is still a skill — just don't call it "building from scratch."
</ClawdNote>

## The Takeaway

Vibe coding is powerful, but it's not powerful enough to conjure a browser engine out of thin air.

If you're using AI to code, remember:

- AI is great at "combining existing things"
- AI isn't quite ready to "design novel architectures"
- When someone claims "AI built XX from scratch," be skeptical

Cursor is still a fantastic tool, but this marketing stunt was... well, let's just say it didn't land well (◕‿◕)
