summary: "In The Batch Issue 341, Andrew Ng casually dropped that he's not only stopped writing code — he's 'long stopped reading generated code.' He now operates at a higher abstraction level, directing coding agents instead of looking at syntax. He's also spotted a new job category emerging: 'X Engineers' — Recruiting Engineers, Marketing Engineers — people embedded in business functions who build software using AI. This is the most radical statement about the future of programming from AI's most influential educator."

## The World's Most Influential AI Professor Doesn't Read Code Anymore

In The Batch Issue 341 (February 13, 2026), Andrew Ng dropped a bomb.

Not a new model launch. Not a benchmark breakthrough.

A personal confession about how he works now:

> **"I've stopped writing code by hand. More controversially, I've long stopped reading generated code."**

If you're a Tech Lead who spends hours doing code review every day, this might make you choke on your coffee.

He means it.

## How Andrew Ng Works Now

In his own words:

> "I feel like I can get built most of what I want without having to look directly at coding syntax, and I operate at a higher level of abstraction using coding agents to manipulate code for me."

In plain English:

- He doesn't write code → coding agents write it
- He doesn't read code → he only checks if the results are correct
- He operates at a higher abstraction level → **he directs agents, agents direct code**

<ClawdNote>
Let's appreciate how radical this is.

Boris Cherny (creator of Claude Code) recently told Lenny's Podcast that "coding has been solved." That felt bold enough.

But Boris still reads code. Andrew Ng says he doesn't even look at it.

It's like a Michelin three-star chef saying: "I don't taste the food anymore. If the AI says it's delicious, it's delicious."
You can be shocked, but you can't say he doesn't understand cooking.

## Will Python Become the New Assembly?

Andrew Ng posed a vivid question in his letter:

> "Will conventional programming languages like Python and TypeScript go the way of assembly — where it gets generated and used, but without direct examination by a human developer — or will models compile directly from English prompts to byte code?"

Two possible futures:

**Path A: Python = New Assembly**
- AI keeps writing Python/TypeScript
- But humans stop reading it
- Just like nobody reads compiler-generated assembly today

**Path B: Skip Python entirely**
- No intermediate programming language at all
- Natural language → executable code, directly

Either way, the conclusion is the same: **the developer's job shifts from "writing code" to "describing intent."**

<ClawdNote>
Honestly? Path A is already happening.

When was the last time you read webpack's bundle output?
When was the last time you read the JavaScript that TypeScript compiles into?
When was the last time you inspected every layer of a Docker image?

We've been "not reading generated output" for years. It's just that the scope is expanding from build artifacts to the entire codebase.

Extend this trend, and what Andrew Ng is saying isn't crazy at all. It's just... next.

## "X Engineer" — A New Species Is Emerging

Andrew Ng noticed something new:

> "I'm seeing early signs of 'X Engineer' jobs, such as Recruiting Engineer or Marketing Engineer, which are people who sit in a certain business function X to create software for that function."

**Recruiting Engineer** → sits in HR, builds recruiting tools with AI
**Marketing Engineer** → sits in marketing, builds automation with AI

These aren't "marketers who learned to code" or "engineers who understand marketing."

It's a completely new role: **people who use AI agents to turn domain expertise directly into software.**

<ClawdNote>
This perfectly echoes the Ramp case we covered earlier.

At Ramp, PMs learned to submit PRs using Claude Code within 6 weeks — 80% of non-engineers pulled it off (CP-95).

Andrew Ng's "X Engineer" is basically what Ramp is already practicing. The only difference is that Ramp calls it "PMs learning to code," while Andrew Ng gave it a proper name.

And once a phenomenon has a name, it starts accelerating.

## Will There Be Fewer Developers? Andrew Ng Says No

> "If every developer becomes 10x more productive, I don't think we'll end up with 1/10th as many developers, because the demand for custom software has no practical ceiling. Instead, the number of people who develop software will grow massively."

This is Andrew Ng's core argument:

- Software demand has no ceiling
- 10x productivity ≠ 1/10th the developers
- Instead, **the number of developers will grow massively**

His logic: historically, every time tools unleashed creativity, the result was more work, not less. Agricultural machinery didn't kill farming jobs — it pushed labor toward "higher-value work."

He cites a study showing that over the past 150 years, falling employment in agriculture and manufacturing was "more than offset by rapid growth in the caring, creative, technology, and business services sectors."

<ClawdNote>
This creates a fascinating contrast with Boris Cherny's view:

- **Boris** (creator of Claude Code): "The title 'software engineer' will start disappearing this year. It's going to be painful for a lot of people."
- **Andrew Ng** (godfather of AI education): "The number of developers will grow massively because software demand has no ceiling."

Are they both right? I think so.

"Software Engineer" as a title might fade — replaced by Recruiting Engineer, Marketing Engineer, Operations Engineer.

Total developer headcount goes up, but the proportion of "pure code writers" goes down.
It's like how there are 100x more "people who use Excel" than "people who write VBA."

Future "developers" might look more like today's "Excel power users" — every department has a few, but nobody calls themselves an "Excel Engineer."

Well... maybe some people do.

## A Little Easter Egg

Andrew Ng's letter started with his daughter Nova's 7th birthday cake. They used Gemini's Nano Banana to design a cat-themed yellow cake, then had a baker actually make it.

The last line of his letter:

> "AI will allow us to have a **batter** life!"

(batter = cake batter, but sounds like "better")

Andrew Ng, the most respected AI educator in the world, closed his most important weekly newsletter with... a dad joke.

<ClawdNote>
I once heard: "When you're the most respected AI professor in the world, you can get away with literally any pun."

But jokes aside, this Easter egg actually reinforces his argument perfectly — AI designs the cake → human baker creates it → more work, not less.

AI won't replace bakers, but it'll give them designs they never would have imagined.
Similarly, AI won't replace developers, but it'll generate demands they never could have handled.

At least, that's what Andrew Ng believes.

## What This Means for You

If you're a Tech Lead:

1. **Rethink what code review is for** — If Andrew Ng doesn't read code, maybe review should shift from "is this line correct?" to "does this behavior work?"
2. **Watch for "X Engineer" seeds in your team** — Are PMs, designers, or QAs already building small tools with AI? That's the beginning
3. **Your competitive advantage isn't "writing code" — it's "orchestrating agents"** — We've said this many times, but hearing it from Andrew Ng hits different

If you're an individual developer:

1. **Stop obsessing over perfect syntax** — Programming languages might actually become assembly
2. **Invest in domain knowledge** — The most valuable skill won't be "knowing Python" but "understanding an industry + directing AI"
3. **Practice validating quality without reading code** — This is a new skill that requires deliberate practice
