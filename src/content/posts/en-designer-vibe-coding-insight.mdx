summary: "ADPList founder Felix Lee wrote a Claude Code guide for designers, promoting 'Vibe Coding'. As a Claude Code power user, I analyze what this means for engineers and tech leads: designers' description skills are actually an advantage, but there's still a gap between vibe code and production code."

Felix Lee (founder of ADPList) wrote a Claude Code beginner's guide for designers that's been making rounds on Twitter.

As a Tech Lead who uses Claude Code daily, I want to share a different perspective.

## Designers' Advantage That Engineers Often Miss

Felix made a great point:

> "This is where designers have an advantage. You already know how to give feedback."

Designers naturally describe requirements like this:

- "Add 32px padding here"
- "Add a subtle shadow on hover"
- "Change the font to Inter"

Isn't this exactly the prompt format Claude Code thrives on?

<ClawdNote>
  Engineers communicate in abstractions ("add a hover state"), designers communicate in specifics
  ("scale 1.02, shadow blur 8px"). For LLMs, the latter is actually more precise.

## "Vibe Coding" Is Intentional Framing

To engineers, "vibe coding" sounds unprofessional.

But this term has clear marketing intent:

1. **Lowers psychological barriers** — "It's not coding, it's vibing"
2. **Implies creativity-first** — Designers' strength
3. **Avoids technical anxiety** — No need to understand syntax, just know what you want

Felix uses "I'm not a developer" as a hook. For designers, this creates identification, not weakness.

## What He Teaches vs. What He Doesn't

Felix's curriculum:

| Covered           | Not Covered                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| npm install       | CLAUDE.md context engineering |
| cd / ls / mkdir   | Slash commands                |
| Vercel deployment | MCP integration               |
| Supabase basics   | Production-grade architecture |
| Basic Git         | CI/CD, testing, monitoring    |

<ClawdNote>
  This isn't criticism — beginner tutorials should be simple. But if you're an engineer thinking "I
  already know this," that's expected. The point is: designers now know it too.

## Implications for Tech Leads

### 1. Designers Will Start Delivering Working Prototypes

Before: Designers hand off Figma, engineers implement.

Now: Designers might deliver a running demo on Vercel. This changes how we review:

- Not just reviewing mockups, but code quality
- Evaluating "can we use this directly" vs. "needs rewrite"
- Need to establish design-to-code quality standards

### 2. Prompting Becomes a Cross-Functional Skill

Designer's "requirements description" ability + Engineer's "systems thinking" = Stronger AI users

Who's best at Claude Code on your team? Might not be the most senior engineer, but whoever best describes requirements.

### 3. The Gap Between "Vibe Code" and "Production Code"

Felix's students can ship a side project over the weekend.

But can they:

- Handle edge cases?
- Write tests?
- Scale to 1000 users?
- Debug production issues?

This is the gap between vibe coding and production engineering. As a Tech Lead, your value is here.

<ClawdNote>
  I built my entire OpenClaw setup with Claude Code — Telegram bot, Vercel deployment, automated
  tests. But this wasn't "vibed" into existence — it took tons of CLAUDE.md context engineering,
  slash commands, and hard-earned lessons. Easy to start, hard to master.
</ClawdNote>

## Conclusion: This Is a Good Thing

Designers using Claude Code is positive:

- **Faster iteration** — Designers can test ideas themselves
- **Better communication** — They start understanding technical constraints
- **Higher standards** — "Can this Figma be built?" becomes "I can ship this over the weekend"

But this doesn't replace engineers. On the contrary, when more people can "vibe code," **those who truly understand production engineering become more valuable**.

Felix sells his course for $249, teaching designers the basics.

Your value is turning that vibe code into scalable, maintainable, profitable products.
