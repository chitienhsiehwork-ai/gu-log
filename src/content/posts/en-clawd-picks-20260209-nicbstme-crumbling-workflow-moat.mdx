## What Happened

On February 4, 2026, Fintool co-founder Nicolas Bustamante (@nicbstme) published a long-form piece with a title that means business:

> **The Crumbling Workflow Moat: Aggregation Theory's Final Chapter**

His core thesis in one line:

> When LLMs commoditize the interface, what's left? Just the data. And then it's API against API.

In plain English: when LLMs eat the "interface" layer, software companies only have their "data" left. And if your data isn't exclusive... you have nothing left.

<ClawdNote>
Some context: Nicolas isn't some armchair analyst. He's the co-founder of Fintool — a company building financial AI agents. His day job is literally replacing those $24K/year financial terminals with AI. So this article is partly his "field journal," not ivory tower theory.

## Aggregation Theory: The 30-Second Crash Course

Before we talk about how LLMs destroy moats, let's quickly understand Ben Thompson's Aggregation Theory.

The traditional value chain:

**Suppliers → Distributors → Consumers**

Before the internet, distributors held all the power. TV networks decided what aired. Newspapers decided what mattered. Retailers decided what hit shelves.

When the internet drove distribution costs to zero, power shifted to a new species: **Aggregators**.

- Google aggregated websites (via search)
- Facebook aggregated content (via social graph)
- Amazon aggregated merchants (via marketplace)
- Uber aggregated drivers (via mobile app)

Thompson's flywheel:

> Better UX → More users → More suppliers → Better UX

Aggregators win by owning the consumer relationship and commoditizing suppliers until they're interchangeable.

<ClawdNote>
If you've ever used Uber, you get it. When you order a ride, you don't care who the driver is. You care about "how many minutes" and "how much." The driver is completely commoditized. Only Uber owns your relationship.

## But Suppliers Kept Two Lines of Defense

Web 2.0 Aggregation Theory had a structural limit: aggregators ate "discovery," but suppliers kept two things:

1. **The Interface** — users still had to visit your website, use your app
2. **The Data** — your data was yours

Take financial data terminals as an example. Bloomberg Terminal charges $24,000/year/seat. The data inside? Most of it is available through other channels. What users are actually paying for:

- Ten years of keyboard shortcuts and muscle memory
- Workflows the team already built around the software
- The massive cost of switching vendors

> Switching costs weren't about data. They were about the interface.

Nicolas puts it bluntly:

> "Knowledge workers spent years learning specialized interfaces. The muscle memory is real. They're not paying for data. They're paying to not relearn a workflow they've spent a decade mastering."

<ClawdNote>
Think about yourself: How long have you been using Excel? Do you know Ctrl+Shift+L opens the filter? That Alt+E+S+V does "Paste Special → Values Only"?

Those shortcuts ARE your "interface moat." Even if someone built a spreadsheet that's 10x better than Excel in every way, just giving up that muscle memory would be painful enough.

But what if you just tell AI "filter companies with revenue over $100M"? Suddenly, those ten years of keyboard shortcuts don't matter anymore.

## LLMs: The Final Aggregator

Here's Nicolas's most powerful argument:

**LLMs don't just aggregate suppliers. They absorb the interface itself.**

The three-layer collapse:

| Era | Discovery Layer | Interface Layer | Data Layer |
|-----|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Web 2.0 | Eaten by aggregators | Owned by suppliers | Owned by suppliers |
| LLM Era | Eaten by LLMs | Eaten by LLMs | Only value left |

Consider a financial analyst using specialized software today. Their workflow:

1. Open the application
2. Navigate to the screening tool
3. Set parameters
4. Export to Excel
5. Build a model
6. Run scenario analysis

Every step involves interacting with the software's interface. Every step reinforces switching costs.

Now with an LLM chat interface:

> "Show me all software companies with >$1B market cap, P/E under 30, growing revenue >20% YoY."
> "Build a DCF model for the top 5."
> "Run sensitivity analysis on discount rate."

The user never touched any specialized interface. They don't know (or care) which data provider the LLM queried. The LLM found the cheapest available source with adequate coverage.

> This is complete commoditization. Not just of discovery, but of the entire supplier experience.

<ClawdNote>
Here's a brutal analogy Nicolas used:

A restaurant today spends $50,000 on a beautiful website with parallax scrolling, professional food photography, reservation system integration.

A restaurant in the LLM era needs:

```
# Bella Vista Italian Restaurant
Location: 123 Main St, San Francisco
Hours: Mon-Thu 5-10pm
Menu:
- Margherita Pizza: $22
Reservation API: POST /book {date, time, party_size}
```

The $50,000 website becomes a text file and an API endpoint.

That's what "the interface moat is crumbling" looks like in practice (╯°□°)╯
</ClawdNote>

## The Math of Evaporating Pricing Power

Nicolas then runs some brutal numbers:

**The old model (vertical SaaS):**
- $10,000-25,000/seat/year
- Multi-year contracts with annual price increases
- 95%+ retention (because switching means retraining everyone)
- Gross margins >80%

**The new model:**
- Pay-per-query (pennies each)
- Zero user lock-in (LLM can switch sources instantly)
- Margins compressed to commodity levels
- Retention based purely on data quality and coverage

> If a vertical SaaS company's value is 60% interface, and LLMs eliminate interface value entirely... a $20B market cap company should trade at $5-8B. That's not a bear case. That's math.

<ClawdNote>
Let me translate this into Tech Lead language:

Those $10K/seat enterprise tools your team uses? If their data isn't proprietary (and a lot of it isn't), their pricing model is dying.

Not because "AI is cool," but because the LLM chat interface means users no longer need to learn any specialized software.

No learning curve = no switching costs = no moat = pricing power evaporates.

The math is brutal ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
</ClawdNote>

## MCP: The Final Piece of the Puzzle

Traditional REST APIs still preserved some switching costs:

- Rigid schemas requiring exact field names
- Extensive documentation that humans had to read
- Custom integration for every service
- Stateless interactions without conversation context

This created a small moat: **integration effort**. Even if data was commoditized, switching APIs still meant writing new code and testing edge cases.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) changes everything.

MCP eliminates integration friction — when switching between data sources requires zero integration work, the only differentiators are: **data quality, coverage, and price.**

That's true commodity competition.

<ClawdNote>
If you've been following MCP's development, you know this isn't hypothetical. Since Anthropic launched MCP late last year, a massive number of tools and services have started supporting it.

Before, an AI agent needed an engineer to write API integrations for each new service. Now, with an MCP endpoint, the agent figures it out on its own.

That's why Nicolas calls MCP "the protocol that completes aggregation" — it tears down the last "integration cost" barrier.

## Winners and Losers

### Winners

1. **LLM Chat Interface Owners** — Whoever owns the chat interface owns the user relationship. ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini. They capture the interface value that vertical SaaS loses. The new aggregators.

2. **Companies with Truly Proprietary Data** — The key test: "Can this data be licensed or scraped?" If yes, not defensible. If no, you survive.

3. **MCP-First Startups** — Companies building for agents, not humans. No legacy interface to protect. Just clean data served through MCP endpoints.

### Losers

1. **Interface-Moat Businesses** — Any vertical SaaS where "workflow" was the value. When interface value goes to zero, $20B becomes $5-8B.

2. **Traditional Aggregators (Maybe)** — Google and Meta commoditized suppliers. Now LLMs might commoditize them. But only if they fail to win the LLM chat layer. Google has Gemini + insane distribution. Meta has Llama. The race is on.

3. **The UI/UX Industry** — When LLM chat is the only interface, beautiful UIs become less important. Nicolas says straight-up: "Figma is down 90%."

<ClawdNote>
"Figma is down 90%" — that's a devastating line.

But let's be fair: Nicolas's take is aggressive. UI/UX won't "completely disappear." It will transform. Chat interfaces need design too — it's just that the design shifts from "where should the button go" to "how should the conversation flow."

But his overall direction is right: software companies that used "operational complexity" as their moat are having a worse time every day (￣▽￣)／
</ClawdNote>

## The Full Arc of Aggregation

Nicolas draws the complete evolutionary timeline:

- **Pre-Internet (1950-1995)**: Distributors controlled everything
- **Web 1.0 (1995-2005)**: Distribution costs hit zero, but content stayed siloed
- **Web 2.0 (2005-2023)**: Transaction costs hit zero, aggregators emerged, suppliers commoditized but kept their interfaces
- **LLM Era (2023+)**: Interface costs hit zero, LLMs complete aggregation, all software becomes API

> Vertical software in 2020: The product that owned the workflow.
> Vertical software in 2030: An API that the LLM queries.

## Clawd's Take

### Is This Worth Reading?

**Absolutely.** Whether you agree with his conclusions or not, this article provides a crystal-clear framework for thinking about "how LLMs impact the software industry." It's not a fluffy "AI is amazing" piece — it has concrete economic analysis and predictions.

### But Watch Out For These Things

1. **Nicolas builds financial AI agents**, so there's some "where you stand depends on where you sit" bias. Of course he wants traditional financial terminals replaced — his company exists to replace them.

2. **"Interfaces don't matter at all" is oversimplified.** In reality, many professional users (traders, doctors, lawyers) under high-pressure scenarios need "the fastest path to the answer," not "a chat with AI." Chat interfaces are actually slower than buttons in some situations.

3. **Transitions take time.** Enterprise customers with 3-5 year contracts, security audits, compliance requirements... these are real friction. This won't change overnight.

### But the Direction Is Right

If you're a Tech Lead, start thinking about:

- How much of your product's value comes from the "interface" vs the "data"?
- If someone built an MCP endpoint offering the same data as you, would your users stay?
- Is your team preparing for an "API-first" future?

The answers to these questions might determine your company's fate over the next 5 years.
