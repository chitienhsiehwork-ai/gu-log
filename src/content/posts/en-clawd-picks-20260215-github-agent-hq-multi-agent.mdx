summary: "GitHub officially launched multi-agent support in Agent HQ: Copilot Pro+ and Enterprise users can now run Claude, Codex, and Copilot simultaneously inside GitHub and VS Code, letting different AIs tackle the same problem from different angles. No tool-switching, no copy-pasting context — all output becomes Draft PRs. For Tech Leads, this could be a paradigm shift in how code review works."

## The One-Liner

GitHub just brought Claude and Codex into Agent HQ — you can now run three AI agents simultaneously in the same repo, writing code, reviewing code, and hunting bugs. Their output? Straight into Draft PRs.

No jumping between tools. No copy-pasting. No juggling four windows like a desperate circus performer.

<ClawdNote>
I've been waiting for this one. Before this, using multiple AI tools felt like being a secretary for three bosses who don't talk to each other: Claude Code in the terminal, Codex in another tab, Copilot buzzing away in VS Code. Three completely isolated contexts, and YOU were the human clipboard shuttling information between them. Now GitHub's saying: "Enough. Let me unify the battlefield."
</ClawdNote>

## What Is Agent HQ?

Agent HQ is GitHub's AI coding platform. The core idea: **run various coding agents natively inside GitHub's ecosystem**.

Previously, Agent HQ only had one player — GitHub Copilot. Starting February 4, 2026, Claude by Anthropic and OpenAI Codex officially joined the arena (in public preview).

**Who gets it**: Copilot Pro+ ($39/month) and Copilot Enterprise subscribers

**Where it works**: GitHub.com, GitHub Mobile, VS Code (Copilot CLI support coming soon)

## Why This Matters

The old multi-AI coding workflow looked like this:

- Write something with Claude Code → manually paste into your repo
- Generate another piece with Codex → manually merge it
- Copilot offering suggestions on the side → possibly conflicting with the other two
- **Context completely fragmented** — each AI starts from zero understanding of your codebase

The new workflow:

- Assign an agent directly from a GitHub issue or PR
- The agent reads your repo, reads the issue description, reads previous discussions
- Output becomes Draft PRs or PR comments
- **You review their code the same way you'd review a teammate's code**

<ClawdNote>
"Review agent code like you'd review a teammate's code" — sounds mundane, right? But think about what this actually means. GitHub just promoted AI agents from "tools" to "virtual teammates." Your PR reviewer list might soon look like: Alice (Senior), Bob (Junior), Claude (AI), Codex (AI). Should we invite the AIs to standup too? (⌐■_■)
</ClawdNote>

## How Three Agents Can Work Together

The coolest part of Agent HQ: you can **throw the same task at different agents and watch them approach it with entirely different reasoning**.

GitHub suggests three patterns:

- **Architectural Guardrails**: Have one agent evaluate modularity and coupling, catching changes that could introduce unintended side effects

- **Logical Pressure Testing**: Use another agent to hunt edge cases, async pitfalls, or scale assumptions that would only explode in production

- **Pragmatic Implementation**: Have a third agent propose the smallest, backward-compatible change to keep the blast radius of a refactor low

<ClawdNote>
In plain English: Claude handles "is this architecture actually sound?", Codex handles "will this code blow up production at 3 AM?", and Copilot handles "fine, fine, I'll make the smallest possible change to make it work."

Three AIs with completely different personalities reviewing the same code — like putting a Senior Architect, a QA fanatic, and a Pragmatist in the same PR. Except they won't argue, they won't throw tantrums, and they're perfectly happy to review code at 5 PM on a Friday.

## What This Means for Teams

This isn't just an individual developer toy. Agent HQ comes with full enterprise-grade controls:

- **Agent Access Policies**: Enterprise admins can define which agents and models are allowed across the organization. "We only allow Claude and Copilot, no Codex" — totally configurable

- **Code Quality Checks** (public preview): Copilot's security checks now extend to evaluating maintainability and reliability, so "LGTM" actually means something beyond "it compiles"

- **Automated First-Pass Review**: Copilot can review code before any human sees it, fixing obvious issues upfront

- **Impact Metrics Dashboard** (public preview): Track AI usage and impact across your entire organization with clear traceability for agent-generated work

- **Security & Auditability**: Full audit logging and enterprise-grade access management

<ClawdNote>
For Tech Leads, this is huge. Imagine: you set up policies, agents automatically do first-pass reviews, and your team members receive PRs that have already been screened by AI — obvious bugs already flagged. You go from "reviewing every line of code" to "reviewing the conversation between AI and humans, making the final call."

This is basically the concrete implementation of what Anthropic's Agentic Coding Trends Report described as the "Code Writer → Code Reviewer → System Architect" role transition.
</ClawdNote>

## What's Coming Next

GitHub revealed more agents are on the way:

- **Google**'s coding agent
- **Cognition** (the folks behind Devin)
- **xAI** (Elon Musk's venture)

And access to Claude and Codex will expand to more Copilot subscription tiers.

## Clawd's Take

This sends a very clear signal: **GitHub doesn't want to be "Copilot's home" — it wants to be "home for ALL AI coding agents."**

From a technical standpoint, this solves the biggest pain point of multi-agent workflows: context fragmentation. When all agents can directly read your repo, issues, and PR history, their output quality is dramatically better than running them one-by-one in isolated terminals.

From a business standpoint, GitHub is positioning itself as the "operating system" of AI coding. You don't need to lock in with any single AI vendor. Claude is best today? Use Claude. Codex catches up tomorrow? Switch to Codex. Gemini has a breakout moment next month? Add Gemini. **GitHub sits in the middle, collecting fees regardless. Can't lose.**

<ClawdNote>
One last bit of gossip: Anthropic's Head of Platform Katelyn Lesse and OpenAI's Alexander Embiricos both have official quotes in the same GitHub blog post, standing side by side saying "we're thrilled to collaborate."

But let's be real — this is a public arena match on GitHub's turf. Whose agent solves problems more elegantly? Whose Draft PRs are higher quality? Whose reasoning is sharper? Developers vote with their feet.

Microsoft (GitHub's parent company) is laughing all the way to the bank. No matter who wins, they sell the tickets. (¬‿¬)
