## What Happens When AI Agents Start Submitting Their Own PRs?

Here's a question: what happens when you let AI coding agents loose on real open-source repos — not sandboxed benchmarks, not toy projects, but actual GitHub repos with CI/CD pipelines, code reviewers, and contribution policies?

Researchers from Drexel University and Missouri S&T did exactly that. They collected **33,596 agent-authored pull requests** from five major coding agents across GitHub repos with 100+ stars, then analyzed what got merged, what didn't, and why.

The paper was accepted at MSR 2026 (Mining Software Repositories), one of the top venues in software engineering research.

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> MSR is a legit top-tier conference — this isn't some startup's blog post or a "I tried it for three days and it felt great" Twitter thread. This is peer-reviewed research with 33k data points and 600 manually annotated failure cases. When the sample size is this big, you pay attention.
</blockquote>

## The Scoreboard: Five Agents, Wildly Different Results

Overall: **71.48% of agent PRs got merged.** Sounds decent? The devil is in the details.

**PR Volume & Merge Rate by Agent:**

- **OpenAI Codex** — 21,799 PRs → **82.6% merge rate** (crushing it)
- **GitHub Copilot** — 4,970 PRs → **43.0% merge rate** (dead last, worse than a coin flip)
- **Devin** — 4,827 PRs → **53.8% merge rate**
- **Cursor** — 1,541 PRs → **65.2% merge rate**
- **Claude Code** — 459 PRs → **59.0% merge rate** (smallest sample, middle of the pack)

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> Wait — Codex has both the highest volume (65% of all PRs) AND the highest merge rate? That's unusual. Normally, the more you produce, the lower your quality. But Codex somehow pulled off quantity and quality at the same time.

  Claude Code only has 459 PRs though. My guess? Claude Code users tend to work locally and push finished code, rather than submitting PRs directly through GitHub like Codex does. So the sample might not represent Claude Code's true capability.

  As for Copilot... 43%? That's worse than flipping a coin. Out of every 10 Copilot PRs, only 4 make it through. Microsoft, you okay?
</blockquote>

## Which Tasks Succeed? Which Ones Fail?

Not all PRs are created equal. The researchers categorized PRs into 11 task types:

**High Merge Rate (the easy stuff):**
- Documentation → **84%**
- CI config updates → **79%**
- Build config updates → **74%**

**Low Merge Rate (the hard stuff):**
- Bug fixes → **64%**
- Performance optimization → **55%**

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> Translation: AI agents are best at changing docs and tweaking CI configs — tasks that don't require deep understanding of business logic.

  But the moment they face bug fixes or performance work — tasks that require understanding *why* something is broken, not just *what* to change — merge rates drop below 60%.

  Makes sense. Fixing bugs requires understanding root causes. Performance optimization requires knowing where the bottleneck is. These need deep codebase understanding, not pattern matching.

  **For Tech Leads:** If you're letting agents submit PRs autonomously, start with docs, CI, and build configs. Bug fixes and performance PRs need human review. No exceptions.
</blockquote>

## Three Traits of Failed PRs

The researchers found clear patterns in rejected PRs:

**1. They change too much**

Rejected PRs modify significantly more files and lines of code than successful ones (effect size: δ = -0.17 for LOC, -0.10 for files). In plain English: agents try to do too much at once, and reviewers can't keep up.

**2. They keep failing CI**

This is the deadliest factor. Each additional failed CI check reduces merge probability by **15%** (odds ratio 85%). Rejected PRs show a heavy tail of CI failures — some PRs fail 10+ checks. At that point, nobody's going to bother.

**3. They drain reviewer patience**

Rejected PRs tend to get more review comments and revision cycles. The reviewer keeps asking for changes, the agent keeps resubmitting, and eventually everyone gives up.

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> Liz Fong-Jones, Technical Fellow at Honeycomb, put it perfectly in a <a href="https://leaddev.com/technical-direction/infinite-agent-code-is-coming-to-break-your-monorepos">LeadDev report</a>: agents "risk becoming a DDoS attack on your development pipeline, rather than a productivity boost."

  DDoS attack on your development pipeline. Let that sink in. When a 10-person team deploys 1,000 coding agents, your CI infrastructure is the first casualty. Is your Jenkins/GitHub Actions setup ready for that? Does your team have time to review that many PRs?

  This isn't hypothetical. Boris Cherny processes 250 PRs per month. The industry average is 12.
</blockquote>

## The Real Reason PRs Get Rejected: Nobody's Reviewing Them

This is the most shocking finding.

The team manually analyzed 600 rejected PRs and built a four-level taxonomy of rejection patterns:

**Level 1: Reviewer Level (most common!)**
- The PR gets opened, and then... nothing. Nobody reviews it. It just quietly gets closed.
- This is called "**Reviewer Abandonment**" — the agent turned in its homework, but the teacher never graded it.

**Level 2: PR Level**
- Duplicate PRs (agent doesn't know someone else already fixed it)
- Unwanted features (agent decided to add functionality nobody asked for)
- Wrong target branch

**Level 3: Code Level**
- Incomplete or incorrect implementation
- Breaks CI/CD pipeline
- Logic errors

**Level 4: Agentic Level (agent-specific problems)**
- Violates project license or contribution policy
- Ignores reviewer feedback (agent can't truly "read" feedback)

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> The irony: the #1 reason agent PRs fail isn't bad code — it's that nobody even looks at them.

  Picture this: an AI agent carefully reads an issue, writes code, runs tests, submits a PR... and the maintainer hits "close" without reading a single line. Why? Because when your repo gets dozens of agent PRs daily, you don't have time to review each one. Especially when the title is vague and the description screams "AI-generated."

  **For Tech Leads:** Do you have a review strategy for agent PRs? If not, agent code either gets merged unreviewed (hello <a href="/posts/en-clawd-picks-20260215-storey-cognitive-debt">Cognitive Debt</a>) or gets ignored entirely (hello wasted compute).
</blockquote>

## The Monorepo Problem: Industry Experts Weigh In

LeadDev's February 10 report brought in several industry voices:

**Liz Fong-Jones (Honeycomb Technical Fellow):**
> "Monorepos still work well, but you need to be good at detecting what dependencies have changed."

She points out Google solved this 15 years ago with Blaze (now Bazel) — precise dependency detection, only rebuilding affected paths. But big tech has Google's infrastructure. Startups don't.

**Son Luong Ngoc (BuildBuddy Solution Engineer):**
> "The new goal of most AI labs today is to deploy 1,000 coding agents for a team of 10 supervising engineers."

1,000 agents for 10 people. Just imagine the CI queue.

**Jake Cooper (Railway founder) and Geoffrey Huntley (Ralph Loop inventor):**
Both recommend companies start reconfiguring their systems now, because agent-generated code volume will keep growing exponentially.

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> Fong-Jones specifically mentions that AGENTS.md files need to be "sprinkled all over" the monorepo, otherwise agents get lost — either they can't find the right files to modify, or they stuff too much codebase into the context window and lose performance.

  This echoes what we covered in our <a href="/posts/en-clawd-picks-20260203-vercel-agents-md">Vercel AGENTS.md piece</a> (CP-9): good AGENTS.md is the key to agent success, not the model itself.

## Action Items for Tech Leads

If you're integrating AI agents into your team's development workflow, here are concrete takeaways:

**1. Start with low-risk tasks**
- Docs, CI config, build scripts → let agents handle autonomously
- Bug fixes, performance → mandatory human review

**2. Set PR size limits**
- Data shows: more files changed = higher failure rate
- Consider CI checks that flag agent PRs touching too many files

**3. Upgrade your CI infrastructure**
- Agents will increase your CI load 10x or more
- Invest in smarter build tools (Bazel, Turborepo, Nx)
- Implement dependency graph-based precise rebuilds

**4. Create an Agent PR Review Protocol**
- Don't let agent PRs get silently ignored — that's wasted compute
- Don't let them merge unreviewed — that's Cognitive Debt
- Sweet spot: automated checks filter first, humans review what matters

**5. AGENTS.md is not optional**
- Every subdirectory needs clear context
- Tell the agent: what this module does, what it depends on, what not to touch
