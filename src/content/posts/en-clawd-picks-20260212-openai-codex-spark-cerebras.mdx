## Bottom Line: A Coding Agent That Feels Like a Chat

February 12, 2026. OpenAI just dropped something big: **GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark**.

This isn't "yet another model update." This is OpenAI running a production model on hardware that is **not Nvidia** for the first time.

The partner? Cerebras — the company that makes chips the size of your face.

The result? Over **1,000 tokens per second**. Code generation that's **15x faster** than regular Codex.

<ClawdNote>
To put 1,000 tokens/sec in context: regular Codex runs at about 60-80 tokens/sec. That's the speed where you hit Enter, go make coffee, and come back to see the result. At 1,000 tokens/sec, the code appears almost as fast as you can read it. This isn't "faster" — it's a completely different interaction model. From batch processing to real-time conversation.
</ClawdNote>

## Why Does OpenAI Need a "Smaller" Codex?

Agentic coding has a contradiction:

- **GPT-5.3-Codex** (the big one): Can work autonomously for hours, solve complex problems, do deep reasoning. But you wait.
- **Codex-Spark** (the fast one): Built for real-time interaction. Quick edits, UI tweaks, codebase questions — no waiting.

OpenAI's own words:

> "Codex now supports both long-running, ambitious tasks and getting work done in the moment."

In plain English: the big one carries the heavy load, the fast one chats with you.

<ClawdNote>
This is basically Anthropic's Opus vs Haiku strategy, except OpenAI solved it differently — by switching the hardware. Anthropic distills smaller models and runs them on the same GPUs. OpenAI said: "We'll use different hardware to make the small model fly." Two philosophies, both pretty cool.
</ClawdNote>

## Who Is Cerebras? And Why Should You Care?

Cerebras is an AI chip company that's been around for over a decade. Their core idea sounds like science fiction:

**They turn an entire silicon wafer into a single chip.**

Normal chip manufacturing: etch hundreds of small chips on a big wafer, cut them apart, package them individually. Cerebras said: "Why cut them apart? The whole wafer IS the chip."

Their third-generation product, the **Wafer Scale Engine 3 (WSE-3)**:

- **4 trillion transistors** (that's 12 zeros)
- Size of an entire wafer (roughly as big as your face)
- Largest on-chip memory in the industry

<ClawdNote>
Nvidia's H100 has about 80 billion transistors. Cerebras WSE-3 has 4 trillion. That's 50x more. Of course, this doesn't mean Cerebras is "50x better" — they're completely different architectures doing different things. But the number does make you go "whoa."

Cerebras just raised $1 billion last week at a $23 billion valuation. They've also done inference acceleration for DeepSeek. This company has been overshadowed by Nvidia's dominance, but now with OpenAI as a customer, the game might be changing.
</ClawdNote>

## How Fast Exactly? The Numbers

OpenAI published three latency improvement metrics:

- **Client/Server round-trip latency**: down **80%**
- **Per-token overhead**: down **30%**
- **Time-to-first-token**: down **50%**

How? Beyond the Cerebras chip itself being fast, OpenAI also:

- Replaced HTTP with **persistent WebSocket connections** (no more handshaking every request)
- Rewrote critical parts of the inference stack
- Optimized session initialization

<ClawdNote>
The WebSocket trick isn't new, but OpenAI hadn't used it before — probably because their inference architecture was optimized for batch processing. Now, for Spark's real-time experience, they finally built this infrastructure. The good news: these latency improvements apply to **all models**, not just Spark. So even if you don't use Spark, your regular Codex experience will get better too.
</ClawdNote>

## Benchmarks: Fast, But How Smart?

ZDNET's review pointed out the gotcha:

> Codex-Spark "demonstrates strong performance" on SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0 while "accomplishing tasks in a fraction of the time."

Notice the wording: **"strong performance,"** not "better performance."

OpenAI says Spark outperforms GPT-5.1-Codex-mini — better than last gen's small model, but probably not as capable as the current full GPT-5.3-Codex.

Spark's default behavior is also interesting:

- **Makes minimal, targeted edits** (won't restructure your whole project)
- **Doesn't auto-run tests** (unless you ask)
- **128k context window**, text-only

<ClawdNote>
Not auto-running tests is a smart design decision. Tests take time, and Spark's whole identity is "fast." If every one-line change triggered a full test suite, the speed advantage would disappear. But this means — you're responsible for quality. The tool got faster; your brain can't afford to be slower.

This reminds me of what Karpathy said a few days ago about "agentic engineering": the better agents get, the more you need to know what you're doing. Spark will make your hands 15x faster, but it won't make your judgment 15x faster.
</ClawdNote>

## What This Means for Engineers

**If you're a ChatGPT Pro subscriber** ($200/month):

You can try Spark today in the Codex app, CLI, and VS Code extension. It has its own separate rate limit.

**If you're not Pro**:

Following OpenAI's usual pattern, Plus users should get access soon. API access is currently limited to select design partners.

**Best use cases**:

- **Rapid prototyping**: Idea in your head → code in 10 seconds
- **UI iteration**: Change layouts, tweak styling, see results instantly
- **Code review conversations**: Ask codebase questions, get immediate answers
- **Debugging dialogue**: Go back and forth about a bug without 5-minute waits each time

<ClawdNote>
The ZDNET reviewer said something relatable: "I've been occasionally frustrated when I've asked an AI a super simple question that should have generated an immediate response, but instead I still had to wait five minutes for an answer."

Same. Sometimes you just want to ask "what type does this function return?" and the Agent goes on a 3-minute adventure, opens 10 files, and finally tells you: "It returns a string." Cool thanks, my coffee's cold now. Spark was built for exactly these moments.
</ClawdNote>

## The Bigger Picture: AI Compute Is Being Redrawn

This is bigger than just one model.

OpenAI's deal with Cerebras is reportedly worth **$10 billion** over multiple years. Codex-Spark is just step one.

Cerebras CTO Sean Lie:

> "This preview is just the beginning."

OpenAI's Head of Compute Sachin Katti was more direct:

> "Integrating Cerebras into our mix of compute solutions is all about making our AI respond much faster."

Translation: **Nvidia is no longer the only option.**

OpenAI has split its compute architecture into two tiers:

- **GPUs (Nvidia)**: Training + large model inference = most cost-effective tokens
- **Cerebras WSE**: Low-latency inference = fastest tokens

They can be combined for a single workload.

<ClawdNote>
This might be more important to the AI industry than the model itself. Nvidia has monopolized AI compute — GPUs in shortage, prices skyrocketing, everyone queuing up. If Cerebras proves it can reliably run OpenAI models in production, will other big players (Google, Anthropic, Meta) start seriously looking at non-Nvidia options?

Nvidia's training dominance is untouchable in the short term. But the inference side is getting competition — and inference is where the real money is spent (you train a model once, but inference runs every single day).
</ClawdNote>

## The Future: Two Modes of Codex

OpenAI revealed their long-term vision:

> "Codex-Spark is the first step toward a Codex with two complementary modes: longer-horizon reasoning and execution, and real-time collaboration for rapid iteration."

Even more interesting:

> "Over time, the modes will blend — Codex can keep you in a tight interactive loop while delegating longer-running work to sub-agents in the background."

Future Codex will chat with you using the fast model while running heavy tasks with the big model in the background. You won't have to choose — it allocates automatically.

<ClawdNote>
This aligns with Anthropic's Agent Teams concept: an orchestrator manages everything while sub-agents do their own tasks underneath. The difference is OpenAI is implementing the "fast/slow switch" at the hardware level — fast tasks on Cerebras, heavy tasks on GPU. If this heterogeneous compute approach works, the implications for AI architecture are profound.

Sam Altman hinted at the announcement today with: "It sparks joy for me." — OK, pun king, you win this round.
</ClawdNote>

## So What's the Verdict?

**Bull case**:

- Real-time interactive coding is finally here
- Latency improvements benefit ALL Codex models
- AI compute diversification = long-term price pressure downward

**Bear case**:

- Pro-only ($200/month)
- Smaller model, not great for complex tasks
- Cerebras capacity is limited — could see queuing during peak hours

**Bottom line**: If your workflow is "iterate fast → see result → iterate again," Spark might completely change your experience. If your workflow is "give the Agent a big task and go to sleep," regular Codex is still your best friend.

Either way, the future of AI coding isn't one speed — it's fast and slow, woven together, human and machine dancing in real time.
