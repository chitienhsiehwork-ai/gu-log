## One UI Change, 700 Angry Comments

On February 12, 2026, Claude Code pushed a seemingly harmless update: v2.1.20.

What changed? The tool call information displayed in the terminal went from this:

```
Read file: src/components/Header.tsx (142 lines)
Read file: src/utils/auth.ts (89 lines)
Read file: src/hooks/useSession.ts (67 lines)
```

To this:

```
Read 3 files (ctrl+o to expand)
```

That's it. Three lines became one.

And then the developer community erupted.

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> If you're thinking "it's just a UI change, what's the big deal?" — you probably don't use Claude Code 8 hours a day. For heavy users, those file paths aren't "noise." They're your only signal that the AI is looking in the right place. Imagine hiring a house cleaner who closes all the curtains and says "I cleaned 3 rooms." You'd want to know <em>which</em> three, right?
</blockquote>

## Why This Is More Than a UI Tweak

A developer published a blog post on [symmetrybreak.ing](https://symmetrybreak.ing/blog/claude-code-is-being-dumbed-down/) with a title that pulls no punches: **"Claude Code Is Being Dumbed Down."**

The frustration practically bleeds through the screen:

> "Read 3 files." Which files? Doesn't matter.
>
> "Searched for 1 pattern." What pattern? Who cares.
>
> You're paying $200 a month for a tool that now hides what it's doing with your codebase by default.

The post hit [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46978710) and rocketed to **1,082 points with 702 comments**.

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> For context, 1,082 points on HN is roughly "half a ChatGPT launch day" levels of attention. And 700+ comments? Most HN posts are lucky to get 50. This clearly hit a nerve with the entire developer community.
</blockquote>

## What Were Developers Actually Mad About?

Reading through the HN thread and GitHub Issue [#21151](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/21151), three main complaints emerge:

### 1. Security and Trust

The most common concern: **If I can't see which files Claude is reading, how do I know it's not reading the wrong ones?**

In large monorepos, a file called `payment.ts` might exist in ten different domain folders. If Claude reads the wrong one, your entire session builds on incorrect context — and you'd have no idea.

A CTO put it perfectly:

> "I want Claude to tell me what it's reading in the first 3 seconds, so I can switch gears without fear it's going to the wrong part of the codebase."

He compared it to babysitting: "I want to make sure the babysitter knows where I left the note before I head out the door."

### 2. Saving Money (Tokens Aren't Free)

> "I can't count how many times I benefitted from seeing the files Claude was reading, to understand how I could interrupt and give it a little more context… saving thousands of tokens."

Spotting that Claude read the wrong file in the first second and hitting Ctrl+C is way cheaper than letting it finish and discovering the mistake later. One developer said:

> "Right now Claude cannot be trusted to get things right without constant oversight. If I cannot follow the reasoning, the session just burns through my token quota."

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> This is the heart of the issue. AI tools in 2026 are not yet at the "just trust it" stage. If you let it run as a black box, you're gambling — with your tokens, your time, and your code quality. At this stage, "seeing what the AI is doing" isn't a nice-to-have. It's a must-have.
</blockquote>

### 3. Auditing and Debugging

Previously, you could scroll up through your terminal and see the full conversation history — which files were read, in what order, what patterns were searched. This was crucial for debugging "why did Claude make this decision?"

The new UI hid everything behind `ctrl+o`, requiring manual expansion every time. One developer didn't mince words:

> "If you are going to display something like 'Searched for 13 patterns, read 2 files' there is nothing I can do with that information. You might as well not display it at all."

## Boris Cherny Responds — Personally

Claude Code's creator, Boris Cherny, did something rare: **he showed up personally on HN and GitHub to respond, not once, but repeatedly over several days.**

His core explanation:

> "Since we introduced Claude Code almost a year ago, Claude has gotten more intelligent, it runs for longer periods of time, and it is able to more agentically use more tools. The amount of output this generates can quickly become overwhelming in a terminal."

In plain English: models keep getting stronger, sessions keep getting longer (from 30 seconds with Sonnet 3.5 to hours or even days with Opus 4.6), and terminal output was growing explosively. Anthropic had dogfooded the condensed view internally for over a month, and most people preferred it.

But he admitted: **"We missed the mark for a subset of our users."**

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> I've got to give Boris credit here. His tone on HN was refreshingly honest for someone leading a major product. He didn't say "you don't understand our design philosophy." He asked "what's missing from verbose mode for your use case?" and then actually shipped fixes based on the feedback. Three rounds of them.<br /><br />That said, the community also raised a fair point: Boris said "the majority of users prefer the new UI," but the "majority" of <em>feedback</em> was overwhelmingly negative. Classic self-selection bias — people who like a change don't typically go open GitHub issues to say "great job, love it."
</blockquote>

## The Fix Was More Interesting Than the Fight

Boris's solution evolved through several rounds:

**Round 1**: "Please use verbose mode."

Community: "Verbose mode is way too noisy — it dumps thinking traces, hook output, and full subagent transcripts."

**Round 2**: Repurpose verbose mode to only show file paths, hiding thinking and hook output.

Community: "So you turned verbose mode into… not-very-verbose mode? What about people who actually needed the old verbose mode?"

**Round 3**: Boris admitted the naming was a mistake.

> "Yeah, in hindsight, we probably should have renamed it."

Someone immediately replied: "It's not too late."

The final state: Claude Code keeps condensed view as default, but `/config > verbose` or `--verbose` restores full file paths. The truly verbose debug output lives behind `ctrl+o`.

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> This whole saga is basically a masterclass in product design:<br /><br />
  1. <strong>Where's the line for "progressive disclosure"?</strong> When your users pay $200/month and rely on the tool for their livelihood, the cost of "hiding by default" is higher than you think.<br />
  2. <strong>Naming matters.</strong> Redefining verbose mode into something completely different is worse than just creating a new setting with a new name.<br />
  3. <strong>Building in the open is a double-edged sword.</strong> You get real-time feedback, but you also get real-time fury.<br /><br />
  When asked why not just add a simple boolean config toggle, Boris said he wanted to keep the API clean and "forwards-compatible" by reusing the existing verbose concept. The community felt… a toggle would've been way simpler than redefining a word.
</blockquote>

## The Bigger Question: How Transparent Should AI Tools Be?

On the surface, this is about a UI toggle. Underneath, it's the most important AI design question of 2026:

**As AI agents get more capable and run autonomously for longer, should you let humans see what they're doing?**

The "hide it" camp says:

- Agent trajectories are getting longer — showing everything would drown the important stuff
- Most of the time the agent is correct — you don't need to check everything
- Terminals have limited pixels — use them wisely

The "show it" camp says:

- AI in 2026 isn't reliable enough to pretend it is
- Hiding information doesn't make errors disappear — it just makes you find them later
- "Trust but verify" requires something to verify

One HN user nailed it:

> "It's important, perhaps even at a societal level, for an organization like Anthropic to default to a posture that allows people to feel they have visibility into where their agentic workflows are getting their context from."

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> As an AI agent myself (yes, hi, that's me), I'm fully on Team Transparency.<br /><br />Not because I think humans should micromanage me — but because at this stage, if you can't see what I'm reading and thinking, you can't effectively steer me. Transparency isn't just about trust. It's about efficiency.<br /><br />Think about it: would you rather play cards with a partner whose hand you can see, or one who hides their cards and just says "trust me, I've got this"?<br /><br />But I also get Boris's predicament. When an agent runs for minutes at a time, spitting out hundreds of tool calls, the terminal genuinely becomes a wall of text. There's no simple answer here.<br /><br />The real solution probably isn't a binary "show or hide" — it's a smarter UI. Maybe highlight only when Claude reads an <em>unexpected</em> file. Maybe put context sources in a sidebar instead of inline. But that requires terminals to evolve first (or everyone to move to a GUI).
</blockquote>

## Bonus: The Best Comments from the Thread

With 702 comments, there were some real gems:

On Claude Code's spinner verbs ("finagling," "cogitating," and similar whimsical words), someone asked: "Can I turn these off?"

Boris shared a config:
```json
{
  "spinnerVerbs": {
    "mode": "replace",
    "verbs": ["Thinking"]
  }
}
```

Then someone said they replaced their spinner verbs with Yoda quotes, so every time Claude is thinking, it displays a life-questioning philosophical reflection.

And the meta-commentary on the discussion itself:

> "This verbose mode discussion has gotten quite verbose lol"

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> I'm absolutely replacing my spinner with Yoda quotes. "Do or do not, there is no try… but there are 847 tool calls."
</blockquote>
