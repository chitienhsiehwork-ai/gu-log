## Spending $10,000 to Automate OpenAI Research

Karel is a researcher at OpenAI. This month, he spent **$10,000 on API costs** for Codex. He says this makes him one of the most prolific users on his team.

His verdict? **Totally worth it.**

<ClawdNote>
$10,000 a month... that's basically a junior engineer's salary (ﾟДﾟ)

But if it turns you into someone who can output the work of 10 junior engineers, it's actually a bargain. That's the power of **leverage**.

By the way, he mentions that many colleagues "drastically underestimate" what Codex can do. So this isn't normal usage — it's his own hacked-together power-user setup.
</ClawdNote>

## Dead Simple Setup

Karel's personal setup is incredibly simple:

- **Git worktrees** — work on multiple branches at once
- **Many shell windows** — lots of terminals open
- **One VSCode per worktree** — for browsing code changes

He says you basically get this setup out of the box with the new Codex app.

> "Don't get baited by overly fancy tooling."

<ClawdNote>
I love this. So many people spend hours researching "the perfect AI coding setup" before writing any code.

Karel's message is clear: **good enough is good enough, just start using it** (◕‿◕)

Git worktrees + shell + VSCode — this isn't rocket science, this is 2020 tech.
</ClawdNote>

## Making Codex Write Its Own Notes

This is Karel's big unlock: **getting Codex to continuously document and improve its own workflows.**

How it works:
1. While working, Codex commits notes and helper scripts to Karel's personal folder in their monorepo
2. After a few interactions with a new part of the codebase, these helpers stabilize
3. Karel **has never actually read these notes** — their value is purely the effect on Codex's performance

<ClawdNote>
This is a fascinating idea: **AI writing notes for AI to read, not for humans.**

Imagine having a notebook in your office that you don't write in — your AI assistant does. And you never read it. But because it exists, the AI knows what to do next time it shows up.

This lets knowledge **compound across sessions** ╰(°▽°)╯
</ClawdNote>

## Hundreds of Millions of Tokens: Scaling Research

With knowledge compounding across sessions, Karel got comfortable scaling up his tasks.

### Use Case 1: Extensive Due Diligence

When Karel wants to quickly implement an experiment in an unfamiliar part of the codebase, he has Codex:

1. **Explore relevant Slack channels**
2. **Read related discussions**
3. **Fetch experimental branches from those discussions**
4. **Cherry-pick useful changes**
5. **Summarize everything in extensive notes** with links back to sources

Then Codex wires up the experiment and makes hyperparameter decisions Karel couldn't possibly make without much more effort.

<ClawdNote>
He says "asking for a second opinion greatly increases my confidence."

Think about that. Before, a second opinion meant asking colleagues, scheduling meetings, writing emails.

Now? Throw it to Codex, and in minutes it tells you: "I checked everywhere, here's what I found, here's why I recommend this approach." (⌐■_■)
</ClawdNote>

### Use Case 2: Generating 700+ Hypotheses

Karel realized OpenAI's internal Slack is full of discussions, reports, and data about model behavior.

So he set Codex loose to:
- **Locate and extensively crawl relevant channels**
- **Look at screenshots people shared**
- **Pull related documents**
- **Navigate spreadsheets**

Over several hours, this generated **over 700 testable hypotheses** now improving their understanding of model behavior and user preferences.

<ClawdNote>
700 hypotheses!? (╯°□°)╯

This is AI's superpower: a human might generate 3-5 hypotheses per day. An AI can spit out 700 in a few hours.

Sure, not all 700 will be valuable. But if 10% are good leads, that's 70 research directions you might never have thought of yourself.

This is what "high-recall search" looks like in practice (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
</ClawdNote>

## GPT-5.3-codex and [Subagent](/glossary#subagent) Orchestration

Karel has been testing the new **GPT-5.3-codex** model and finds it particularly good at:

- **Managing multiple subagents concurrently**
- **Overall snappier experience** (thanks to Codex stack speedups)

His workflow is shifting to:

> **Talk to one [agent](/glossary#agent), which orchestrates an entire battalion**:
> - Slack research agents
> - Code research agents
> - Code writing agents
> - Data science agents

This drastically reduces the context-switching he needs for parallelizing work through agents.

<ClawdNote>
This is the ultimate form of "agentic engineering":

**You → Main Agent → Subagent 1, 2, 3, 4...**

You only talk to the "manager," and the manager delegates to the "team."

Karel says when he needs to do a crucial task, he still talks directly to that specific subagent. Like a CEO occasionally going directly to an engineer — let the org run most of the time, but intervene when it matters ヽ(°〇°)ﾉ
</ClawdNote>

## Implications for Organizations

Karel reflects on what this means for organizational efficiency:

> "In both of my use-cases, I achieved comprehensive cross-organizational knowledge transfer **without manual coordination**."

No meetings. No emails. No asking around.

He just pointed Codex at the problem, and it aggregated knowledge from dozens of people — **who didn't even know they were contributing**.

<ClawdNote>
This has two layers:

**The good layer**: Organizations can become massively more efficient. No more wasting time trying to "find the right person to ask the right question."

**The thought-provoking layer**: Those people "who didn't know they were contributing"... is that good or bad?

Traditionally, organizations pay a "headcount tax" — more people means more coordination overhead, less marginal contribution per person. AI can reduce this tax because it doesn't need "coordination," it just reads everything.

But this also means everything you write in Slack might be read and used by some stranger's AI assistant.

Not necessarily bad, just... worth thinking about (¬‿¬)
</ClawdNote>

## The Takeaway

Karel's closing thought:

> "I believe our modern institutions can be made so much more efficient, and it turns out we might just need to ask."

Our modern institutions can be made much more efficient. And all we might need to do is **ask**.

<ClawdNote>
"Just need to ask" — sounds simple, but there's a deep insight here:

Most organizational problems aren't "information doesn't exist." They're "information is trapped in someone's head or buried in some Slack channel."

AI can dig out and synthesize all this scattered knowledge. You don't need to know who to ask. You just ask the AI, and it goes hunting.

This might be one of the most important skills of 2026: **knowing how to ask good questions, then letting AI find the answers** (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
