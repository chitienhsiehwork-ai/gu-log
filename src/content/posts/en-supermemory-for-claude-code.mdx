**We added Supermemory to Claude Code. Now it's ridiculously powerful...**

Today, we launched the Supermemory plugin for Claude Code!

> TLDR: You can now use Supermemory in Claude Code.

Claude Code really changed how I work. But one thing drove me crazy... **Every day, I have to explain the exact same things to it.**

I have to constantly repeat my coding style, preferences, etc.

- "User service connects to Postgres, not MySQL."
- "Don't refactor that function — I know it's ugly but it's intentional."

Claude writes great code. Then I close the session and it forgets everything.

Next day? **Groundhog Day**. Again. We built a bunch of workarounds — giant CLAUDE.md files, pasting context before every prompt, maintaining "memory" documents the agent seemingly never reads...

So we built something.

The concept is simple: **Claude Code should know you. Not just this one session — forever.** It should know your codebase, your preferences, your team's decisions, and context from every tool you use.

## Here's How It Actually Works:

### 1. It Remembers Where You Left Off
We use User Profiles to build your file. Claude knows your goal this week is "reduce costs and migrate to another Postgres provider."

### 2. It Learns Your Style
Instead of writing cookie-cutter code like everyone else's, it learns as you use it — like "use less useEffect!!!"

Claude Code now remembers how you fixed a bug last time. This knowledge compounds into an agent truly customized for you.

### 3. It Knows "You"
It knows if you're a founder, college student, or systems engineer, and suggests tools and implementations accordingly.

```
Developer: "I need to add rate limiting to this endpoint"

Agent: "Based on the rate limiting you implemented in the payments-api
last month (using sliding window with Redis), and your preference for
the express-rate-limit middleware, here's an approach that matches
your existing patterns..."
```

## Technical Core: Hybrid Memory

This isn't regular RAG.

Memory isn't just "find similar stuff."

- It's understanding when you say "that auth bug," you mean the one you've been debugging for three days.
- It's knowing your preferences evolved — you used to like Classes, now you prefer Functions.
- It's tracking how a decision was made, revisited, then changed.

Our **Hybrid Memory** system extracts facts, tracks how they change over time, builds your profile, and retrieves the right context at the right moment.

In LongMemEval benchmarks, we scored **81.6%**. (Regular RAG systems score around 40-60%)

## How Is This Different from MCP?

Supermemory MCP is great, but has a major limitation: **We can't control when Claude Code executes tools.**

This means we can't learn from it.

This plugin adds:
- **Context Injection:** Auto-injects User Profile at session start.
- **Automatic Capture:** Conversation content gets captured and stored for future use.

These weren't possible with just MCP before.

## Community Q&A Highlights

<Toggle title="Q: How much token consumption?">
**@nichm asked:** How many tokens does this add? I have budget constraints.

**DhravyaShah replied:** Supermemory has about a **5000 token** budget. These tokens are dynamically replaced, so roughly max 5000 memories.

<Toggle title="Q: Does it support multiple codebases?">
**@wells_harrison asked:** I have 4 client projects with different tech stacks. Can it handle that?

**DhravyaShah replied:** Yes it can!

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> This is important. You don't want AI chatting about your Vue project architecture while writing React. Context separation is essential.
</blockquote>

<Toggle title="Q: Privacy concerns?">
**@ChandanAILab asked:** What about enterprise privacy? Can backend people see the data?

(Not yet answered, but this is usually the biggest concern for enterprise adoption. Though Supermemory open-sourced the plugin, privacy concerns exist if the backend service is SaaS.)
