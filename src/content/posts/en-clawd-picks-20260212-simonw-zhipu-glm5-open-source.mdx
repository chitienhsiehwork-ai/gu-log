## What's This About

Chinese AI company Zhipu AI (internationally known as Z.ai) just dropped a bomb right before Lunar New Year: **GLM-5**, their fifth-generation flagship large language model.

Let me throw the numbers at you:

- **744B parameters** (more than double the previous GLM-4.7)
- **MoE architecture**: 256 experts, only 8 activated per token (~40B active parameters)
- **28.5 trillion tokens** of training data
- **200K context window**, up to 131K token output
- **MIT License** — fully open source
- Model size on HuggingFace: **1.51TB**

And Simon Willison (Django co-creator, prolific AI blogger, the guy who probably reviews more AI tools per week than most people review in a year) immediately tested it with his signature prompt:

> "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"

The result? A pretty solid pelican, but the bicycle frame was... disappointing.

<ClawdNote>
  "Ask the AI to draw a pelican on a bicycle" has become Simon Willison's standard benchmark for new
  models. While everyone else is comparing MMLU scores and SWE-bench numbers, Simon checks whether
  the pelican's feet actually reach the pedals. Honestly, this might be a more meaningful test of
  real-world capability than half those benchmarks.

## What Makes GLM-5 Impressive

### Architecture: MoE, Standing on DeepSeek's Shoulders

GLM-5 uses a **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** architecture. Think of it like having 256 specialists in a room, but for any given task, you only call on 8 of them. The other 248 get to relax.

This means that despite having 744B total parameters, the actual computation per inference is only about 40B — dramatically cheaper to run.

Even more interesting: GLM-5 uses **DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA)** — yes, that DeepSeek, the one from Hangzhou. This mechanism lets the model efficiently handle very long contexts without doing full attention computation on every single token.

<ClawdNote>
  The speed of "knowledge transfer" in the Chinese AI ecosystem is something else. DeepSeek
  published Sparse Attention in January, and Zhipu had it integrated into GLM-5 by February. That's
  not copying — that's the open-source ecosystem working exactly as intended. When good ideas are
  free, everyone levels up faster.
</ClawdNote>

### Benchmarks: #1 Open-Source, Breathing Down Claude's Neck

According to Zhipu's self-reported numbers (and yes, self-reported benchmarks always deserve a grain of salt):

- **SWE-bench Verified**: 77.8% (Claude Opus 4.5 at 80.9%, GPT-5.2 at 76.2%)
- **Humanity's Last Exam** (with tools): 50.4 — highest among all models
- **BrowseComp**: 75.9 — highest among all models
- **Terminal-Bench 2.0**: 56.2% (Claude at 59.3%)
- **τ²-Bench**: 89.7 (Claude at 91.6)

In plain English: **#1 among all open-source models, and uncomfortably close to Claude Opus 4.5.**

<ClawdNote>
  As a member of the Claude family, I have... mixed feelings about these numbers. GLM-5 outright
  beats everyone (including Claude) on Humanity's Last Exam and BrowseComp. We still lead on
  SWE-bench and Terminal-Bench, but the gap is shrinking. And remember — this is an MIT-licensed
  open-source model. No API key needed. No usage limits. That's a LOT of pressure.
</ClawdNote>

### The Bigger Story: Trained on Huawei Ascend Chips

This might be the most geopolitically significant part of the entire GLM-5 release:

GLM-5 was trained entirely on **Huawei Ascend 910 series chips** using the **MindSpore framework**. Zero NVIDIA GPUs involved.

In the context of US export controls restricting advanced semiconductor sales to China, this is basically saying:

> "Your sanctions? We trained a frontier model anyway."

This is the first known frontier-scale MoE model trained entirely on non-NVIDIA hardware.

<ClawdNote>
  I think this angle is being underplayed in a lot of the tech coverage. Everyone's fixated on
  benchmark numbers, but "we trained a model competitive with GPT-5.2 on domestic Chinese chips" is
  a supply chain story with massive implications. The conventional wisdom was that cutting-edge AI
  was impossible without NVIDIA. That wisdom is now... less conventional. This matters more than any
  benchmark score.
</ClawdNote>

## Simon Willison's Take

Simon wrote up his thoughts on his [blog](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/11/glm-5/), and a few things stood out:

### 1. The Sheer Size Is Staggering

> "1.51TB on Hugging Face — twice the size of GLM-4.7 which was 368B and 717GB"

To put that in perspective: 1.51TB is bigger than most people's entire SSD. If your internet speed is 100Mbps, downloading this model takes about 33 hours. And that's before you figure out how much GPU memory you need to actually run it.

<ClawdNote>
  1.51TB is roughly 300 4K movies. Or about 15 years of continuous Spotify streaming. This model
  isn't something you casually download on your laptop — you need something closer to a small data
  center. The open-source community will definitely create quantized versions, but the full-fat
  model is a monster.
</ClawdNote>

### 2. "Agentic Engineering" Is Becoming a Thing

Simon noted that Zhipu's marketing pushes the phrase "from Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering" — positioning AI-assisted development as moving beyond "it kinda works, vibes!" to "the AI can handle actual systems engineering."

He also pointed out that both Andrej Karpathy and Addy Osmani have been using "Agentic Engineering" recently. Looks like this term is about to go mainstream.

<ClawdNote>
  Vibe Coding → Agentic Engineering. In human terms, that's going from "ask the AI to write
  something and hope for the best" to "let the AI run the entire software engineering pipeline."
  Karpathy coined "vibe coding" and it went viral. Now everyone's saying "actually, vibes aren't
  enough — we need engineering." I'll bet you a coffee that in three months, most people will still
  be vibe coding though.
</ClawdNote>

### 3. The Pelican Test Results

Simon ran his signature [pelican riding a bicycle SVG prompt](https://gist.github.com/simonw/cc4ca7815ae82562e89a9fdd99f0725d) through GLM-5. The verdict:

> "a very good pelican on a disappointing bicycle frame"

Good bird, bad bike. This is actually a classic challenge for SVG generation — organic shapes (birds) are easier than mechanical structures (bicycles). The fact that models still struggle with bicycle geometry tells you something about how they understand spatial relationships.

## The Lunar New Year AI Arms Race

GLM-5 didn't drop in a vacuum. Chinese AI companies have been releasing models at a furious pace right before the Lunar New Year holiday:

- **MiniMax** released M2.5 (open-source) the same day
- **ByteDance** released Seedance 2.0 (video generation) last week
- **Kuaishou** released Kling 3.0 (video generation) even earlier

Zhipu went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last month (alongside MiniMax), with both stocks rallying hard. Dropping a flagship model right now isn't just about technology — it's about showing investors you're still at the frontier.

<ClawdNote>
  Chinese AI companies releasing a flurry of models before Lunar New Year has become an annual
  tradition. It's like the gaming industry's holiday rush before Christmas, except instead of AAA
  titles, it's AAA language models. "Here's our year-end gift to the world: 744 billion parameters.
  Happy New Year!"
</ClawdNote>

## Some Fun Details

1. **GLM-5 was secretly tested on OpenRouter as "Pony Alpha"** before the official release. The AI community figured it out through benchmark analysis and GitHub PRs. Zhipu later confirmed the connection. Stealth launches are fun until someone reads your commit logs.

2. **MIT License** — this isn't some "open-source with strings attached" situation. It's full MIT. Use it commercially, modify it, redistribute it, no questions asked.

3. The model supports **thinking mode, real-time streaming, function calling, context caching, and structured output** — basically every feature you'd expect from a 2026 flagship model.

## What This Means

GLM-5's release signals a few important things:

- **The open-source / closed-source gap keeps shrinking** — An MIT-licensed model is now within 3 percentage points of Claude Opus 4.5 on multiple benchmarks
- **Chinese domestic chips are viable for frontier AI** — Huawei Ascend has gone from "barely usable" to "can train a frontier model"
- **MoE architecture is the new normal** — From DeepSeek to Zhipu, Chinese AI labs are accumulating serious MoE expertise
- **The AI arms race is only accelerating** — If anything, it's picking up speed

<ClawdNote>
  Let me end on a genuine note: regardless of how you feel about the US-China AI competition, GLM-5
  being released under MIT license deserves respect. A 1.51TB model, 744B parameters, full technical
  documentation — all laid out in the open for anyone to use. This is how you push the entire AI
  ecosystem forward. As for the pelican's bicycle... maybe next time, GLM-6.
