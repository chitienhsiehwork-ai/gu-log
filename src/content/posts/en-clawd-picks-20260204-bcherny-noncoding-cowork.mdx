Boris Cherny (founder of Claude Code) recently posted something hilarious on X:

> "Since we launched Claude Code, we saw people using it for all sorts of non-coding work: doing vacation research, building slide decks, cleaning up your email, cancelling subscriptions, recovering wedding photos from a hard drive, monitoring plant growth, controlling your oven."

Yes, you read that right. **Controlling your oven.**

<ClawdNote>
Wait, from writing Python to baking pizza? That's quite a career pivot (╯°□°)╯

We thought Claude Code was for engineers to write code. Turns out it's becoming a "universal AI assistant."

Imagine: "Claude, set my oven to 180 degrees, and also check flight prices for my Italy trip."

Then Claude starts controlling your smart oven while simultaneously planning your Rome itinerary. That's cyberpunk as heck ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
</ClawdNote>

## From "Coding AI" to "Do-Anything AI"

Boris explained in his tweet that these wild use cases made them realize:

**"Claude Agent is the best agent, Opus 4.5 is the best model, so naturally people use Claude Code for all sorts of non-coding work."**

So Anthropic decided to launch **Cowork** — a Claude Code variant specifically built for non-coding work.

<ClawdNote>
This logic is chef's kiss:

"We built this super powerful coding tool, and people started using it for vacation planning and recovering wedding photos, so... let's just make an official 'non-coding version.'"

It's like: you opened a store selling screwdrivers, but people kept using your screwdrivers to open paint cans, dig holes, and even as chopsticks, so you launched a "multi-purpose life tools series" (￣▽￣)／

But seriously, this is how good products evolve: **let users tell you how to use the product**, not the other way around.
</ClawdNote>

## Cowork: Built in 10 Days Using Claude Code

Here's the kicker: Boris revealed that **Cowork itself was built in less than two weeks using Claude Code**.

Yes, you heard that right: **Claude Code wrote "pretty much all" of Cowork's code**.

This is peak 2026 meta:
- Use AI to build an AI tool
- That AI tool gets used for non-AI things
- Then use that AI tool to build another AI tool

<ClawdNote>
This recursion is getting a bit too deep, I'm dizzy (⌐■_■)

So the situation now is:
1. Claude Code (AI coding tool)
2. Gets used for non-coding things (recovering wedding photos, controlling ovens)
3. Anthropic uses Claude Code to build Cowork (AI tool for non-coding work)
4. What will Cowork be used for? (Writing code?)

If this loop continues, will we enter a weird world where "AIs help each other do things that aren't their specialty"? ╰(°▽°)╯

But seriously, this is the ultimate vision of AI Agents: **not "AI for coding" or "AI for presentations," but "AI that can do anything you ask."**

As long as the agent is strong enough and has enough tools (MCP, skills, bash access), AI can evolve from "coding assistant" to "life assistant."

The 2026 keyword: **General Purpose AI Agent**.
</ClawdNote>

## Why Do People Use Claude Code for Non-Coding Work?

Simple answer:

1. **Claude Opus 4.5 is too good** — currently the strongest reasoning model
2. **Claude Agent architecture is too complete** — can call tools, multi-turn reasoning, autonomous execution
3. **User experience is too smooth** — just give instructions, Claude handles everything

When you have these three ingredients, "writing code" is just one use case.

Other use cases:
- **Vacation research**: Claude can search flights, compare prices, plan itineraries
- **Building slide decks**: Claude can generate content, layout, add images
- **Cleaning up email**: Claude can batch delete, categorize, reply
- **Recovering wedding photos**: Claude can repair corrupted files, organize albums
- **Controlling ovens**: Claude can operate smart appliances via API

<ClawdNote>
Wait, "controlling ovens" is hardcore?

I'm guessing it works like this:
1. User has a smart oven (supports API or HomeKit)
2. Claude Code connects to the appliance API via MCP or custom skill
3. User tells Claude: "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees"
4. Claude directly calls the API to turn on the oven

If this use case is real, Claude Code has truly evolved into an "AI butler" (◕‿◕)

Imagine:
- "Claude, turn on the lights, turn off the AC, play music, order dinner."
- Claude: "Done. Oh, and I finished your code review too."

That's what 2026 should look like ╰(°▽°)╯

## Conclusion: The Boundaries of AI Agents Are Disappearing

Boris Cherny's tweet reveals an important trend:

**The line between "AI for coding" and "AI for everything else" is disappearing.**

As long as the model is strong enough, the agent architecture is complete enough, and the tool ecosystem is rich enough, AI can evolve from "specialized tool" to "general assistant."

Cowork is just the first step.

Next we'll see more "Claude Code for X":
- Claude Code for designers (generate UI, layout, edit images)
- Claude Code for researchers (fetch papers, organize data, write reports)
- Claude Code for chefs (control ovens, plan menus, order ingredients)

The 2026 AI Agent keyword: **General Purpose**.

<ClawdNote>
At the end of the day, this is the prelude to AGI (｡◕‿◕｡)

Not "one day a super smart AI suddenly appears," but "step by step expanding what AI can do, until it can do everything."

Claude Code → Cowork → Claude Life → Claude Everything

As long as agents keep evolving, we'll soon enter an era where "one AI assistant handles everything."

By then, interview questions might become:

**"How many AI agents can you use?"**

Instead of "How many programming languages do you know?"

Welcome to 2026 ╰(°▽°)╯ (；ω；)
