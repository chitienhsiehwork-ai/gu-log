Andrew Ng just announced a partnership with Anthropic to create the "definitive course on Claude Code," taught by Elie Schoppik.

The focus? **Highly agentic coding** — where AI works autonomously for minutes (or longer), not just completing a few lines of code.

<ClawdNote>
Wait, what does "works autonomously for minutes" even mean?

Old-school AI coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot) worked like this: you type something, it suggests the next line. You're the driver, AI is the passenger.

Agentic coding is different: you give AI a task, and it goes off to read files, search the codebase, run tests, fix bugs, run tests again, and then comes back to report "I'm done."

You're the boss, AI is the employee.

This isn't "faster autocomplete." This is "an intern who can actually code" (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

## What Is Agentic Coding?

The core of agentic coding is: **AI can execute multi-step tasks independently**.

Traditional AI coding tool workflow:
1. You write a line → AI guesses the next line
2. You write a line → AI guesses the next line
3. Repeat 100 times

Agentic coding workflow:
1. You say "add this feature"
2. AI plans: which files to modify, which tests to write, which docs to update
3. AI does it, debugging errors along the way
4. AI reports back "Done"

<ClawdNote>
Andrej Karpathy said his workflow is now:

**80% agent coding, 20% manual touchups**

It used to be the reverse: 80% manual coding, 20% autocomplete.

This shift "happened over the course of a few weeks," and he called it "the biggest change in ~2 decades of programming."

By the way, he talks super fast. Even he admits, "I know, and I'm sorry that I speak so fast" (￣▽￣)／

The man literally speaks faster than his brain can keep up sometimes. Respect the hustle.
</ClawdNote>

## Why Do You Need to Learn Claude Code?

Because agentic coding requires a completely different mindset than traditional coding.

**Traditional coding**: You need to know what every line does
**Agentic coding**: You need to know how to "give instructions" to AI, how to review AI output, how to collaborate with AI

It's like going from "driving yourself" to "being a taxi passenger" — you don't need to step on the gas anymore, but you need to clearly explain where you're going, which route to take, and whether you're going the wrong way.

<ClawdNote>
Some people call this "prompt engineering for coding," but I think that's too simplistic.

It's not just about "writing good prompts." It's about redesigning your entire workflow:

- You need to learn **how to write CLAUDE.md** (tell AI what your codebase looks like)
- You need to learn **how to break down tasks** (which tasks are good for AI, which aren't)
- You need to learn **how to validate AI output** (AI makes mistakes, you need to catch them)
- You need to learn **how to iterate with AI** (it's not one-shot, it's a conversation)

This is a new skill tree, and it's somewhat different from the traditional coding skill tree ╰(°▽°)╯
</ClawdNote>

## Why Is Claude Code So Powerful?

According to community discussions, Claude Code + Opus 4.5 is considered by many to be "the best AI coding tool in the world."

Key features:

1. **Long autonomous operation** — AI can work for several minutes without your intervention
2. **True agentic behavior** — Plans, executes, validates, debugs on its own
3. **Speculative branching** — Opus 4.5 proactively lists tradeoffs of different approaches for you to choose
4. **Superior context management** — Can see the entire repo, not just one file

<ClawdNote>
What's "speculative branching"?

It means AI doesn't just give you one answer. It says:

"This feature could be implemented this way, that way, or another way. This approach has advantage X but disadvantage Y, that approach has advantage A but disadvantage B. Which do you prefer?"

This is why Opus 4.5 is so strong — it's not an "obedient tool," it's a "consultant who provides recommendations" (⌐■_■)

By the way, this capability is super useful in System 2 thinking scenarios because it actively explores different solutions instead of just giving you one "seems right" answer.

It's like having a senior engineer who actually thinks through the options instead of just implementing the first thing that comes to mind.

## What Does This Course Teach?

The full curriculum hasn't been released yet, but based on Andrew Ng's description as the "definitive course," it should cover:

- Core concepts of Claude Code
- How to design agentic coding workflows
- How to collaborate with AI on code
- How to debug AI-generated code
- Real-world cases and best practices

<ClawdNote>
Andrew Ng called this the "definitive course." That word carries weight.

"Definitive" doesn't mean "intro course." It means "you learn this and you won't need to learn anything else."

Think about his Machine Learning course from 2012 — that course is still many people's first choice for learning ML in 2026. That's 14 years of being the gold standard.

If this Claude Code course is at that level, it's worth taking seriously ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶

Also, knowing Andrew Ng's teaching style, it'll probably be super clear and accessible even for people who aren't prompt engineering experts yet.
</ClawdNote>

## What Does a 2026 Coding Stack Look Like?

A developer shared his "vibe coding stack" (January 2026 version):

1. **Cursor** — Usage has decreased, but still favorite IDE, mostly with Opus 4.5 Thinking + GPT-5.2-Codex-High
2. **Claude Code** — Using Max 5x plan for coding and other things, "unbeaten value and incredible for true agentic AI"

<ClawdNote>
Notice he said Cursor's "usage has decreased," but he's still using it.

What does that mean?

It means the current workflow is:
- **Cursor** — When you need an IDE, when you need to manually edit code
- **Claude Code** — When you need AI to go off and do an entire task on its own

These two tools aren't competing. They're complementary.

Cursor is like "VSCode with AI help." Claude Code is like "an AI employee who can code" (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧

You'll have both installed.

It's kind of like having both a calculator and Excel. Sure, Excel can do math, but sometimes you just want a calculator. Different tools for different jobs.
</ClawdNote>

## Summary

Agentic coding isn't the future. It's the present.

Andrew Ng's timing for this course is spot-on — we're at the moment when "people who use agentic coding" and "people still using traditional coding methods" are starting to diverge in productivity.

If you're a developer, this course should be on your learning list.

If you're still coding "line by line the old way," you might want to consider upgrading your workflow (◕‿◕)

The gap is about to get real wide, real fast.
