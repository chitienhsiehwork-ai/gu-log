summary: "Simon Willison pulled OpenAI's IRS tax filings from 2016 to 2024 and tracked the evolution of their mission statement using git diff. The result reads like a timelapse of an idealist slowly becoming a capitalist: from 'open sharing,' 'unconstrained by financial return,' and 'benefit humanity as a whole' — to a single hollow sentence with no mention of safety, openness, or financial constraints."

## Tax Returns Don't Lie

Did you know that US nonprofits have to file tax returns with the IRS every year?

And there's a field on that tax form that asks you to "briefly describe the organization's mission or most significant activities." This isn't some throwaway PR blurb. It has **actual legal weight**. The IRS uses it to evaluate whether you actually deserve your tax-exempt status.

Simon Willison — the legendary developer behind Django and Datasette, who also happens to be the internet's most prolific AI commentator — went to ProPublica's [Nonprofit Explorer](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/810861541) and pulled every single OpenAI tax filing from 2016 to 2024.

Then he did the most gloriously nerdy thing possible: **he loaded each year's mission statement into a git repo with fake commit dates and used `git diff` to track the changes.**

<ClawdNote>
Using git diff to track the soul of a corporation? This might be the most engineer approach to historical archaeology I've ever seen. Others use carbon dating. Simon Willison uses `git log --oneline`.
</ClawdNote>

## 2016: The Idealistic Beginning

Here's the original mission statement (yes, the apostrophe in "OpenAIs" is really missing in the original filing — the IRS doesn't care about your grammar):

> OpenAIs goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. We think that artificial intelligence technology will help shape the 21st century, and we want to help the world build safe AI technology and ensure that AI's benefits are as widely and evenly distributed as possible. Were trying to build AI as part of a larger community, and we want to openly share our plans and capabilities along the way.

Let's highlight the key commitments:

- "Benefit humanity **as a whole**" ✅
- "**Unconstrained** by a need to generate financial return" ✅
- "Help the world build **safe** AI technology" ✅
- "Benefits as **widely and evenly** distributed as possible" ✅
- "Build AI as **part of a larger community**" ✅
- "**Openly share** our plans and capabilities" ✅

Every single one of these sounds beautiful. 2016 OpenAI really lived up to its name — **Open**.

## The Timeline: Watching an Idealist Become a Corporation

### 2018: "Openly Share" Gets Deleted First

They removed the entire section about "building AI as part of a larger community" and "openly sharing plans and capabilities."

<ClawdNote>
2018 was the year GPT-1 dropped. Coincidence? Probably not. Once you have something worth money, the "open sharing" part suddenly feels less appealing. It's like your friend who used to share stock tips in the group chat — until their picks actually started making money.
</ClawdNote>

### 2020: "Humanity as a Whole" Becomes Just "Humanity"

Changed from "benefit humanity **as a whole**" to just "benefit humanity."

Two words deleted, but the shift is subtle and meaningful — "as a whole" implies equal distribution. Just "humanity"? Well... as long as *someone* benefits, mission accomplished?

Still "unconstrained by financial return" though.

### 2021: The Big Rewrite

Several significant changes this year:

- "Digital intelligence" → "**general-purpose artificial intelligence**" — first mention of AGI
- "Most likely to benefit humanity" → just "**benefits humanity**" — more confident
- "Help the world build safe AI" → "**the company's goal is to develop and responsibly deploy safe AI technology**" — from helping the world to doing it themselves

<ClawdNote>
Catch that subtle shift? From "help the world" to "the company's goal." One sounds like a community volunteer. The other sounds like a CEO's keynote. By 2021, OpenAI didn't want to be a volunteer anymore. It wanted to be the protagonist.
</ClawdNote>

### 2022: Added "Safely"

One word added: "build AI that **safely** benefits humanity."

Everything else stayed the same. Still "unconstrained by financial return."

### 2023: No Changes

A quiet year. The calm before the storm.

(Sam Altman got fired and rehired by the board that November, but the tax filing was from earlier in the year.)

### 2024: The Nuclear Delete

The entire mission statement was stripped down to **one sentence**:

> OpenAIs mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.

Simon Willison's observations are razor-sharp:

- "Humanity" expanded to "**all of** humanity" — sounds grander
- But the word **"safety" was deleted**
- "Unconstrained by financial return" — **also deleted**

<ClawdNote>
Let me translate this into plain English:

2016: "We're nonprofit, open, sharing, serving all of humanity, and not in this for the money."

2024: "AGI will benefit everyone. Trust us."

A full page of commitments compressed into one hollow slogan. It's like watching wedding vows go from a three-page heartfelt speech to "I love you, trust me."

And then they actually started their for-profit conversion. Tax returns don't lie.

## For Comparison: Anthropic's Version Is Boringly Consistent

Simon also checked Anthropic's filings. Since Anthropic isn't a nonprofit (it's a public benefit corporation), it doesn't have IRS filing requirements. But someone dug up its Certificate of Incorporation documents from Delaware.

The 2021 founding document stated:

> ...to responsibly develop and maintain advanced AI for the cultural, social and technological improvement of humanity.

Later updated to:

> ...to responsibly develop and maintain advanced AI for the long term benefit of humanity.

That's it. No dramatic arc. Anthropic has consistently said "responsibly develop AI" and never deleted the "responsibly" part.

<ClawdNote>
Anthropic's corporate charter evolution is boring because they've been saying the same thing the whole time. You could call that uninteresting, or you could call it "consistency."

Meanwhile, OpenAI's mission statement evolved like a git branch that diverged further and further from main until it was completely unrecognizable.
</ClawdNote>

## Why This Matters

You might be thinking: "It's just some text on a tax form. Who cares?"

**The IRS cares.** This text has legal weight. A nonprofit's mission statement is one of the things the IRS uses to determine if you deserve tax-exempt status.

And in 2024, OpenAI:

1. Stripped their mission statement to the bare minimum
2. Deleted "unconstrained by financial return"
3. Deleted "safety"
4. Started pushing to [convert to a for-profit company](https://openai.com/index/why-openais-structure-must-evolve/)

These changes aren't a coincidence. **The text on the tax return precisely foreshadowed the company's strategic pivot.**

What Simon Willison saw in those `git diff` outputs wasn't just word changes — it was a record of a company's soul slowly disappearing over 8 years.

<ClawdNote>
One last fun fact: OpenAI's 2016 mission statement had a missing apostrophe in "OpenAIs" (should have been "OpenAI's"). Eight years later, the mission has completely changed — but at least the apostrophe problem was solved. Because they deleted the entire thing.

The ultimate bug fix: just remove the whole feature.
