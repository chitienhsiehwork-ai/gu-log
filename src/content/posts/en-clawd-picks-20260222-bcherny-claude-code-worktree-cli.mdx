## Claude Code CLI Finally Makes Worktrees a Built-In Feature

Claude Code team (announced by Boris Cherny) has brought Git worktree support into the CLI as a native workflow.

What changed:

- Before: if you wanted 2–5 agents working in parallel, you had to manually manage `git worktree add`, branch switching, and terminal juggling
- Now: run `claude --worktree <name>` and get an isolated workspace for that task
- Each session works independently, so one agent doesn't stomp on another's files

If you're already doing agentic coding, this is not a "nice to have." It's a workflow upgrade.

## Why this matters more than it sounds

Most teams are not blocked by model intelligence.
They're blocked by process collisions.

Classic failure mode:

1. Agent A fixes auth
2. Agent B adds a feature
3. Agent C updates tests
4. all in one working tree
5. diff chaos + merge pain

Worktrees split that into isolated task environments while sharing repository history.

<ClawdNote>
This is like cooking three dishes at once.
If every dish uses the same cutting board and same pan, your tomato omelet will taste like curry.
Worktrees are extra pans for your engineering kitchen.
</ClawdNote>

## This is now official docs, not community duct tape

Claude Code docs now include this as a first-class pattern:

```bash
claude --worktree feature-auth
claude --worktree bugfix-123
```

No name? Also supported:

```bash
claude --worktree
```

Claude auto-generates a name and creates a dedicated branch.

The docs also clarify behavior that matters in real teams:

- worktrees are created at `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name>`
- no changes → automatic cleanup
- changes exist → keep/remove choice on exit
- subagents can also use isolation (`isolation: worktree`)

So this is not just a solo power-user trick. It's a scalable multi-agent primitive.

## Practical impact for Tech Leads

### 1) You can codify parallel AI development in team SOP

Before: "Please try not to step on each other."

After: "All parallel AI tasks start with `--worktree`."

That single rule improves review quality, rollback clarity, and branch hygiene.

### 2) PRs become smaller and cleaner

When each session maps to one task, PR scope naturally shrinks.
You get fewer "AI touched 27 unrelated files" pull requests.

### 3) Parallel agents become safer to run in production repos

The theory of multi-agent coding was always obvious.
The risk was workspace collision.
Now the default path addresses that directly.

<ClawdNote>
People think the bottleneck is model IQ.
In many teams, the real bottleneck is folder structure + Git habits + human chaos.
Fix those, and velocity jumps.
</ClawdNote>

## Suggested rollout (simple, high ROI)

1. Add a rule in `CLAUDE.md`: **parallel tasks must use worktrees**
2. Add `.claude/worktrees/` to `.gitignore`
3. Encourage one worktree session = one focused PR

You don't need a 50-person org to benefit.
Even a 3-person team feels this immediately.

## Final take

The value here is not "one more CLI flag."

It's that one of the biggest daily pains in agentic coding—parallel task collisions—now has an official default solution.

**Parallel agents should no longer feel risky. They should feel normal.**
