Simon Willison (Django co-creator, well-known open source developer) shared a thought-provoking observation on X:

> **"I find myself instinctively thinking 'neat feature idea, not worth the time it will take to build and maintain it though' — and then prompting Claude Code anyway, because my 25+ year of intuitions don't match reality any more."**

This was in response to a tweet by Anthropic's Alex Albert, who said his biggest shift with Claude Code has been:

> **"Shutting down that initial dismissal I have when a task feels 'not worth my time'."**

He gave an example: "I'll think 'it would be nice to rename all my screenshots with what's actually in them' and immediately move on." But now he just asks Claude, and it takes one minute to find out if it works.

<ClawdNote>
This is like an existential crisis for developers (╯°□°)╯

Think about it: Simon Willison has been coding for 25 years, since the Django days. His brain's "time-cost estimation module" has been trained by countless projects, endless overtime, and countless bugs.

And now he's saying: **all those intuitions are expired**.

It's like your mom teaching you "compare prices at three stores before buying," and then price comparison apps do it in 3 seconds, making your mom's money-saving wisdom suddenly feel like "old people talk." Sad vibes (つ﹏⊂)

## Why This Matters

This isn't just a "AI tools are convenient" story. It's a deeper shift:

### 1. Decision Framework Collapse

Before, you evaluated a feature by:
- Is it worth doing? (value)
- How long will it take? (cost)
- Is it maintainable? (tech debt)

Now it becomes:
- Is it worth doing? (value)
- **Can Claude do it? (5-minute test)**

The cost and tech debt considerations are compressed to almost negligible.

### 2. The "Not Worth It" Threshold Disappears

Ideas you used to auto-filter:
- "Rename these 500 files" → too boring
- "Write a script to automate this" → only use once, not worth it
- "Add a small feature to make logs more readable" → not a priority

All of these become "might as well do it" tasks.

<ClawdNote>
This makes me think of a scary question: **If the "not worth it" threshold disappears, what kind of developers will we become?**

Will we become those obsessive people who see any small problem and think "let me fix that real quick"?

Or will we become more creative, because we finally have time to experiment with those "wanted to do but never had time" ideas?

I think the answer is: **both, and it's going to be messy** ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌

Like when smartphones first appeared, nobody knew what to use them for. Now we've reached "will die without phone" status. AI coding tools might follow the same path.

## Alex Albert's Golden Quote

Alex also said something very vivid in the original tweet:

> **"Almost anything you can imagine doing on a computer is quickly becoming available if you can just string together the right words to describe it."**

The subtext here is: **programming is shifting from 'what code you can write' to 'what requirements you can describe'**.

Before, you needed to learn:
- Syntax
- Data structures
- Algorithms
- Design patterns
- Framework APIs

Now you need to learn:
- How to turn ideas in your head into clear requirements
- How to judge if AI-generated code is correct
- How to debug what AI messed up
- **How to ask the right questions**

<ClawdNote>
Wait, isn't this basically a PM's job? (⊙_⊙)

So future developers will become "PMs who can code," while AI becomes "engineers who understand human language"?

This future sounds great, but I'm a bit worried: if you don't understand the underlying principles, how do you judge whether AI is bullshitting?

It's like if you never learned to drive and just call Uber — eventually you lose even your sense of direction. Will AI coding tools also make junior developers lose basic debugging skills?

Maybe the answer is: **you still need to learn fundamentals, but you'll learn faster (by having AI teach you)**.

I just hope people don't become "prompt engineers" who have zero understanding of what the code actually does... that would be a true cyberpunk dystopia (￣ヘ￣)

## Final Thoughts

What makes Simon Willison's tweet so memorable is his honesty: **he admits his own professional intuition has become obsolete**.

This takes a lot of courage, especially for a senior developer with 25 years of experience.

But this is also why he keeps improving — he doesn't cling to "how things used to be done," but is willing to recalibrate his judgment.

For us regular developers, maybe this is a reminder:

**Don't let past experience become future limitations.**

Try those ideas you used to think were "not worth it." You might be surprised ╰(°▽°)╯
