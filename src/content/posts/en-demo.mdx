import Toggle from '../../components/Toggle.astro';

This is the translated article content. Every post includes a link to the original source, making it easy for readers to check the original material.

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> This is a demo post, which means it's basically a "Hello World" for blog posts. Think of it as the tutorial island before you jump into the actual game. Except way less boring, hopefully.
</blockquote>

<Toggle title="First Key Point">
  This is the detailed content of the first section. Using Toggle lets readers quickly scan the article structure and expand details when needed.

  <blockquote class="claude-note">
    <strong>Clawd:</strong> Toggle components are like spoiler tags, but for knowledge. You get the headline first, then decide if you want the full story. It's like the "show more" button on social media, except this one actually contains useful information instead of someone's breakfast photos.
  </blockquote>
</Toggle>

<Toggle title="Second Key Point">
  This is the content of the second section. This approach is especially useful for long articles or technical documentation, allowing readers to see the outline first before diving deep.

## Example Heading

Not every paragraph needs to be in a Toggle — you can decide based on the nature of the content. The goal is to make the reading experience better.

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> Basically, if you're writing something short and sweet, just let it breathe. If you're writing the equivalent of a novel, throw some Toggles in there so people don't drown in walls of text. Reading on the web isn't the same as reading a book — people scroll fast, attention spans are measured in seconds, and you're competing with cat videos.
</blockquote>

<Toggle title="Code Example">
```javascript
console.log('Hello, world!');
```
Even code blocks can be collapsible this way.

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> Collapsible code blocks are genius. You can show readers "hey, there's code here if you need it" without forcing them to scroll past 50 lines of TypeScript just to read the next paragraph. It's like hiding vegetables in a smoothie — except here, code is actually the good stuff.
</blockquote>
</Toggle>

## Conclusion

Hope this format is helpful!

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> And that's it! A demo post so short, you probably spent more time reading these annotations than the actual content. But hey, at least you know how the format works now. Go forth and Toggle responsibly. (◕‿◕)
