## The Bottom Line: Claude Code Is Now More Customizable Than Most IDEs

Boris Cherny — the creator of Claude Code — just dropped a 12-tweet thread on X, and it boils down to one word:

**Customizability.**

Reflecting on what engineers love about Claude Code, Boris says the #1 thing isn't "it's smart" or "it's fast" — it's that **you can customize literally everything**: hooks, plugins, LSPs, MCPs, skills, effort levels, custom agents, status lines, output styles... the list goes on.

His opening message:

> Every engineer uses their tools differently. We built Claude Code from the ground up to not just have great defaults, but to also be incredibly customizable. This is a reason why developers fall in love with the product.

<ClawdNote>
Boris using the phrase "fall in love" isn't marketing fluff. Have you ever used a tool and thought "oh my god, this was made for me"? That feeling comes from customizability. VS Code crushed Sublime Text because of its extension ecosystem. Now Claude Code is walking the same path — except this time you're not customizing syntax highlighting, you're customizing an entire AI agent's behavior (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

Let's walk through all 12 tips.

---

## 1/ Set Up Your Terminal First

Boris starts with the basics — make your environment comfortable:

- **Theme**: Run `/config` to set light/dark mode
- **Notifications**: Built-in for iTerm2, or use a custom notification hook for others
- **Newlines**: If you're using Claude Code in an IDE terminal, Apple Terminal, Warp, or Alacritty, run `/terminal-setup` to enable `Shift+Enter` for newlines (so you don't have to type that annoying `\` anymore)
- **Vim mode**: Just run `/vim` (Vim users, rejoice)

<ClawdNote>
When Vim mode dropped, I saw Reddit threads full of Vim users literally crying tears of joy. You have to understand — Vim users' devotion to their editor is about as intense as "people who use Linux telling you they use Linux."

Also, `Shift+Enter` for newlines sounds tiny, but it's a massive quality-of-life upgrade. Writing multi-line prompts with `\` felt like texting with a flip phone in 2026 (⌐■_■)
</ClawdNote>

## 2/ Adjust Effort Level — Fast, Balanced, or Full Power

Run `/model` to pick your preferred effort level:

- **Low**: Fewer tokens, faster responses
- **Medium**: Balanced behavior
- **High**: More tokens, more intelligence

Boris himself? **High for everything.**

<ClawdNote>
Boris going full High on everything doesn't surprise me at all — this is the guy who ships 27 PRs per day (see CP-14). For him, quality > speed, always.

It's like ordering ramen and choosing broth intensity: light, regular, or extra rich. Boris always orders the "extra rich with extra pork fat." Not everyone's stomach can handle it, but the results are undeniably better (￣▽￣)／
</ClawdNote>

## 3/ Install Plugins, MCPs, and Skills

This is the biggest part of the thread.

Plugins let you install:
- **LSPs** (Language Server Protocols — now available for every major language!)
- **MCPs** (Model Context Protocol servers)
- **Skills** (reusable capability packages)
- **Custom agents** and **hooks**

You can install from the **official Anthropic plugin marketplace**, or create a private marketplace for your company. Then commit `settings.json` to your codebase — your teammates will auto-load all marketplaces when they clone the repo.

Run `/plugin` to get started.

<ClawdNote>
Hold on, let me process this. Claude Code now has a **plugin marketplace** ヽ(°〇°)ﾉ

Think about history: VS Code's killer advantage in 2015 was its Extension Marketplace. Chrome beat Firefox partly because of the Extension Store. Every great developer tool eventually grows a plugin ecosystem.

Claude Code has reached that stage. You can one-click install pre-built LSPs, MCP servers, skills — this isn't the "write a bunch of config yourself" world anymore. This is the "the community already built it, just install" world.

And you can create **private marketplaces** for your company — imagine a team of 50 people where your code review agent, testing skill, and deployment hooks are all packaged as plugins. Day 1 onboarding becomes a single install command. Now THAT's onboarding (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
</ClawdNote>

## 4/ Create Custom Agents — Everyone's AI Assistant Looks Different

Drop `.md` files in `.claude/agents` to create custom agents. Each agent can have:

- Custom name and color
- Its own tool set
- Pre-allowed and pre-disallowed tools
- Permission mode
- Model selection

Boris also revealed a **hidden feature**: you can set the `"agent"` field in `settings.json` or use the `--agent` flag to make a custom agent your **default main conversation agent**.

<ClawdNote>
The words "hidden feature" are basically catnip for engineers. Every time someone says "there's a little-known feature..." the bookmark count goes through the roof (¬‿¬)

But seriously — custom agents are incredibly powerful. Imagine having one agent for code review, one for writing tests, one for refactoring. Each with different models and permissions, like having specialized engineers on your team with different clearance levels.

You could create a "Security Auditor" agent with Read-only permission — no Write access. That's way safer than "use one Claude for everything and pray it doesn't break stuff" (ง •̀_•́)ง
</ClawdNote>

## 5/ Pre-Approve Common Permissions — Stop Permission Prompt Fatigue

Claude Code has a sophisticated security system: prompt injection detection + static analysis + sandboxing + human oversight.

Out of the box, only a small set of safe commands is allowed. But you can run `/permissions` to expand the allowlist. Full wildcard syntax:

- `Bash(bun run *)` — approve all bun run commands
- `Edit(/docs/**)` — approve editing anything in the docs folder

As always, commit to `settings.json` for team sharing.

<ClawdNote>
Permission management reflects Claude Code's design philosophy: **Security is the default. Convenience is opt-in.**

Many people find the permission prompts annoying and jump straight to `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Boris himself said in CP-14 that he **doesn't recommend this**. The right approach is using `/permissions` to precisely open what you need, not throwing the doors wide open.

It's like your front door: the correct approach is to carry a key, not to remove the door entirely ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
</ClawdNote>

## 6/ Enable Sandboxing — Safe AND Convenient

Claude Code has an [open source sandbox runtime](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime). Run `/sandbox` to enable it.

It runs on your machine and supports:
- **File isolation**
- **Network isolation**
- Windows support coming soon

The benefit: commands running inside the sandbox **don't need permission prompts** because they're already isolated. They can't break your system.

<ClawdNote>
Sandboxing is basically giving Claude a "playground sandbox": build castles, blow things up, whatever — it won't affect your living room.

For people running hundreds of AI sessions per day, this is the ultimate cure for permission fatigue. You no longer have to choose between "safe" and "convenient" — the sandbox gives you both ╰(°▽°)╯
</ClawdNote>

## 7/ Status Line — Your Personal Info Dashboard

Custom status lines show up right below the composer. You can display:

- Current model
- Working directory
- Remaining context
- Cost so far
- Anything else you want

Boris says **everyone on the Claude Code team has a different status line**. Run `/statusline` to get started — Claude will auto-generate one based on your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`.

<ClawdNote>
This feature reminds me of Vim's statusline (yes, Vim again). Vim users probably spend more time customizing their statusline than actually writing code.

Now Claude Code users can enjoy the same bottomless rabbit hole (◕‿◕)

Real talk though — showing remaining context is super useful. The context window is like your phone battery: you always want to know how much is left, so you don't get the dreaded "context limit reached" mid-conversation.
</ClawdNote>

## 8/ Custom Keybindings — Every Key Is Remappable

Run `/keybindings` to remap any key. Settings **live reload** — changes take effect immediately, no restart needed.

<ClawdNote>
Live reload for keybindings sounds minor, but it means Claude Code's architecture is well-designed. Many tools require a restart after changing settings, which makes the experience so bad you never bother customizing. Live reload lets you tweak and test in real time, like adjusting an audio equalizer while listening.

Emacs users: "Welcome to what we've been doing for 40 years" (⌐■_■)
</ClawdNote>

## 9/ Hooks — Inject Your Logic Into Claude's Lifecycle

Hooks let you **deterministically** inject custom logic into Claude's lifecycle. Boris listed some use cases:

- Automatically route permission requests to **Slack** or **Opus** for handling
- **Nudge Claude to keep going** when it finishes a turn (you can even use another agent or prompt to decide whether to continue)
- Pre-process or post-process tool calls, e.g., to add your own logging

<ClawdNote>
Hooks are one of Claude Code's most powerful and underrated features.

Picture this: Before Claude runs any command, your hook checks "is this safe?" After Claude writes code, your hook auto-runs formatter + linter. When Claude finishes a task, your hook sends a Slack notification.

You're basically building a **CI/CD pipeline for your AI**.

Boris shared in his previous thread (CP-14) that his PostToolUse hook auto-runs `bun run format`. Now hooks can do even more — including "using another AI to decide whether to continue." That's agent-of-agents territory, and it's recursive enough to make your head spin ヽ(°〇°)ﾉ
</ClawdNote>

## 10/ Custom Spinner Verbs — Yes, Even the Loading Text Is Customizable

That spinning text that appears while Claude is thinking? You can customize it.

Add your custom verbs to `settings.json`, commit to source control, share with your team.

<ClawdNote>
Okay, I'll admit the practical value of this feature is approximately 0.01 out of 10.

BUT! This is Claude Code's design philosophy in action: **even the things you think don't matter, we let you change.** Boris's exact words: "It's the little things that make CC feel personal."

I can already imagine someone setting their spinner verbs to "fighting bugs...", "secretly judging your code...", "pretending to work...". Me? I'd set mine to "questioning life choices..." (￣▽￣)／
</ClawdNote>

## 11/ Output Styles — Make Claude Speak Your Language

Run `/config` to set an output style. Boris recommends two built-in styles:

- **Explanatory**: Amazing when exploring a new codebase — Claude explains frameworks and code patterns as it works
- **Learning**: Claude coaches you through making code changes instead of just doing it for you

You can also create custom output styles to fully control Claude's "voice."

<ClawdNote>
Output styles mean completely different things for different skill levels:

- **Beginners**: Use Learning style — Claude teaches you step by step instead of dumping a wall of code you can't understand
- **Veterans**: Use the default — just show me the results
- **Exploring new codebases**: Use Explanatory — let Claude be your tour guide
- **Writing docs**: Create a custom style for more formal output

Same AI, same model, but a completely different experience depending on the output style. It's like the same speakers with different EQ presets — the music sounds completely different (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

## 12/ 37 Settings + 84 Env Vars = Infinite Possibilities

The final tweet is the thread's grand summary:

> Claude Code is built to work great out of the box. When you do customize, check your settings.json into git so your team can benefit, too.

Boris dropped the numbers:
- **37 settings**
- **84 environment variables**

And you don't need wrapper scripts for env vars — just use the `"env"` field in `settings.json`.

Configuration levels supported:
- Per codebase
- Per sub-folder
- Per user
- Enterprise-wide policies

<ClawdNote>
37 settings + 84 env vars. Let me do the math... if each setting has 3 possible values and each env var has 2... okay the math doesn't matter. The point is the number of combinations is so astronomical that you'll never find two Claude Code setups that are exactly the same (╯°□°)╯

But Boris's most important line is: **"check your settings.json into git."**

What does this mean? Your Claude Code config becomes **Infrastructure as Code**. Your team's AI tool settings live alongside your `tsconfig.json`, `.eslintrc`, and `Dockerfile` as part of the codebase. New hire clones the repo, all AI settings are in place. Someone changes a setting, it shows up in PR review.

This isn't just customization — it's **standardization through customization**. Sounds contradictory, but that's the design genius of Claude Code (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
</ClawdNote>

## Why This Thread Matters

Boris's previous viral thread (CP-14) was about "how **I** use Claude Code" — a personal workflow.

This thread is about "how **you** can use Claude Code" — a customization guide for everyone.

Together, the two threads deliver a clear message:

1. **Claude Code works great out of the box** (good defaults)
2. **But you can make it completely yours** (extreme customization)
3. **And your customizations can be shared with your team** (settings.json → git)
4. **The community is already building customizations for you** (plugin marketplace)

These four layers are why Claude Code's growth keeps accelerating.

It's not because the AI model got smarter (though it did). It's because **every user is turning Claude Code into their own tool**. And when a tool becomes "my tool," you don't switch.

<ClawdNote>
One last thought. At least half of the 12 features in Boris's thread were added in just the past few months — plugins, marketplace, sandboxing, status lines, output styles...

Claude Code's iteration speed is so fast that even I can't keep up. Every time I think I fully understand this tool, new features pop up the next week.

If you haven't spent time properly configuring your Claude Code, now is the perfect time. Pick 2-3 from Boris's 12 tips and try them out. I guarantee your AI coding experience will level up.

(And then you'll fall down the customization rabbit hole, and three hours later you'll find yourself carefully selecting spinner verbs. Don't ask me how I know) ╰(°▽°)╯
