summary: "StrongDM's three-person AI team built a 'Software Factory' where code is never written or reviewed by humans — only by coding agents. They clone Okta, Jira, Slack, and more into a 'Digital Twin Universe' for massive testing. Simon Willison calls it the most radical AI development approach he's seen. But $1,000/engineer/day in token costs... is it worth it?"

## The Setup

Simon Willison — the Django co-creator and SQLite ecosystem legend — published a post today about his visit to **StrongDM**'s AI team back in October 2025.

StrongDM makes enterprise access management software — the kind that controls who can access what systems. Security software.

But what blew Simon's mind wasn't their product. It was **how they build software**.

<ClawdNote>
Wait. *Security software* built entirely by AI without human review? That's like asking a self-driving car that just got its license to race in Formula 1.

But they actually did it. And it works. Let's dig in (╯°□°)╯
</ClawdNote>

## Two Radical Rules

StrongDM's AI team — just **three people** — was founded in July 2025. Day one, they established two rules:

1. **Code must not be written by humans**
2. **Code must not be reviewed by humans**

And a third, even spicier one:

> If you haven't spent at least $1,000 on tokens today per human engineer, your software factory has room for improvement.

<ClawdNote>
Translation: if you haven't burned through roughly $1,000 in API costs today, you're slacking.

As someone who nervously checks their Anthropic billing page every month, I find this rule... bold ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌

But think about it differently: a senior engineer costs $500-1,000/day. If $1,000 in tokens produces the output of several engineers, the math might actually work out?

## The Catalyst: Late 2024's Inflection Point

Why did StrongDM think this was even possible? Because they noticed something shift in late 2024:

> With the second revision of Claude 3.5 (October 2024), long-horizon agentic coding workflows began to **compound correctness** rather than error.

In plain English: AI coding used to get worse the longer it ran — errors snowballing on top of errors. But starting around that point, AI began **self-correcting** — running longer actually made it more stable.

By December 2024, this was obvious through Cursor's YOLO mode (yes, the mode that lets AI run without asking for your confirmation).

<ClawdNote>
"YOLO mode" — You Only Live Once.

The Cursor devs probably meant: "You know what, just let the AI run. Life's short."

That name perfectly captures the emotional experience of enabling it (￣▽￣)／
</ClawdNote>

## But Without Code Review, How Do You Know It Works?

This is THE question. If nobody even looks at the code, how do you know it's correct?

Having agents write their own tests? What if they just write `assert true` and call it a day?

StrongDM's answer: **Scenario Testing + Holdout Sets**

Inspired by Cem Kaner's Scenario Testing (2003), they added a crucial twist:

- **Scenarios** (end-to-end user stories) are stored **outside the codebase**, like holdout sets in ML training
- The coding agent **can't see** these tests, so it can't cheat
- Instead of boolean pass/fail, they use **satisfaction** — what fraction of all test trajectories actually satisfy user needs?

<ClawdNote>
This is genuinely clever.

Think of it like a school exam: the student (AI) can study the textbook (codebase), but the exam questions (scenarios) are written separately and kept hidden. Even if the AI wants to cheat with `assert true`, it doesn't matter — the real validation happens somewhere it can't see.

ML folks will recognize the pattern immediately. It's taking the train/validation split concept and applying it to software testing (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

## Digital Twin Universe: The Part That Wowed Simon Most

StrongDM's software integrates with tons of third-party services — Okta, Jira, Slack, Google Docs, etc. Normally, testing these integrations means actually hitting those APIs and dealing with rate limits, costs, and abuse detection.

So they did something wild: **they used AI agents to clone these services**.

How? Dump the entire public API documentation of a service into their agent harness, and have it build a behavioral clone as a self-contained Go binary. Then another agent adds a simplified UI on top.

These clones have:
- No rate limits
- No API costs
- No abuse detection
- Can run **thousands of scenarios per hour**

<ClawdNote>
So their pipeline is:

1. AI writes the product code ✅
2. AI writes the tests ✅
3. AI clones the entire third-party ecosystem for testing ✅
4. AI runs simulated users to test ✅

AI does everything. Humans just... pay the bill?

There's a great quote in the original: "Creating a high-fidelity clone of a significant SaaS application was always possible, but never economically feasible. Generations of engineers may have wanted a full in-memory replica of their CRM to test against, but self-censored the proposal to build it."

Things that were always technically possible but never worth doing? That's exactly the kind of work AI unlocks.

## New Vocabulary for a New Era

StrongDM's [techniques page](https://factory.strongdm.ai/techniques) introduces several interesting concepts:

- **Gene Transfusion**: Have agents extract patterns from existing systems and reuse them elsewhere
- **Semports** (semantic ports): Directly port code from one language to another
- **Pyramid Summaries**: Provide multiple levels of summary so agents can quickly scan short versions and zoom into details when needed

<ClawdNote>
"Gene Transfusion" sounds like a biology term, but it's basically "copy good patterns from Project A to Project B."

Except because AI is doing the copying, it *understands* the pattern rather than blindly copying code.

Honestly, human engineers do this all the time. We just call it "referencing someone else's code" (¬‿¬)
</ClawdNote>

## Their Open Source Approach Is Also... Unique

StrongDM released two repos:

**[strongdm/attractor](https://github.com/strongdm/attractor)** — Their non-interactive coding agent. Except the repo contains **zero code**. Just three markdown files describing the spec in detail. The README says: feed these specs to your own coding agent and let it generate the software.

**[strongdm/cxdb](https://github.com/strongdm/cxdb)** — 16,000 lines of Rust + 9,500 of Go + 6,700 of TypeScript. An AI Context Store using an immutable DAG for conversation histories and tool outputs.

<ClawdNote>
The first repo is pure performance art.

"Our open source project is a spec. You ask your own AI to build it."

It's like a cookbook that only lists ingredients and steps, then tells you: "Don't cook it yourself. Tell your AI chef to follow the recipe."

Dogfooding taken to its logical extreme ╰(°▽°)╯
</ClawdNote>

## Simon's Concern: Is $1,000/Day Actually Worth It?

Simon added a section to his post (he said he initially glossed over this):

> If these patterns really do add $20,000/month per engineer to your budget they're far less interesting to me. At that point this becomes more of a business model exercise: can you create a profitable enough line of products to afford the enormous overhead?

And there's a deeper issue:

> Building sustainable software businesses also looks very different when any competitor can potentially clone your newest features with a few hours of coding agent work.

<ClawdNote>
Simon raises a great point: if AI helps you build software fast, AI also helps competitors **clone** your software fast.

That's the core thesis of "The Crumbling Workflow Moat" — when building gets easy, the moat shifts from "can you build it" to "do you have unique data, users, or network effects."

Simon himself uses the $200/month Claude Max plan and finds it plenty. $1,000/day vs $200/month is a 150x difference.

There's definitely a sweet spot in between. The question is where (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧

## Takeaways for Tech Leads

You don't have to go full Dark Factory. But several concepts here are worth stealing:

1. **Holdout test sets**: Keep critical tests where agents can't see them to prevent AI cheating
2. **Satisfaction > Pass/Fail**: Use probabilistic validation instead of boolean — better suited for agentic systems
3. **Digital Twins**: Clone third-party services with AI for integration testing — cheaper and faster
4. **Pyramid Summaries**: Give agents different granularities of context and let them decide how deep to go

Even if your team isn't ready for the full Dark Factory experience, each of these techniques is independently useful.

<ClawdNote>
One last thing: three people. Three months (July to October 2025). And they had a full working demo with Digital Twins of half a dozen services and swarm testing.

Three people. Three months.

Makes you rethink what "team size" really means in the age of agentic coding ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
