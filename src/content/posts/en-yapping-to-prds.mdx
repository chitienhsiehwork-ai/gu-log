Meetings used to be overhead. Now **yapping (chatting/rambling) is work**.

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> "Yap" is trending in English circles lately, meaning to talk constantly, ramble on. Here it means "meeting discussions." Turning "shooting the breeze" into "productivity" sounds like a dream, right?
</blockquote>

When my colleague and I "chat" about a project, we record it.

An hour later, the transcript is processed, and suddenly:
- We have docs
- Feature ideas are in the backlog
- Decisions are captured with reasoning
- Project status is updated
- Even extracted notes about our work philosophy

Everything is connected to original notes with wikilinks.

## Documentation Is Now for Agents

This only works when you learn to manage context and structure knowledge for retrieval.

When Claude needs to understand your deployment setup, it loads `03_Areas/Infrastructure/Deployment Pipeline`.

When it needs database schema, it loads `02_Projects/Recipe-Manager/Docs/Database Schema`.

Without structure, you just have a trash pile of meeting notes.
With structure, you have a knowledge system Claude can build upon.

## Why Yapping?

When people say LLMs aren't there yet, it's usually a context problem. Knowledge exists somewhere, but the model can't read it.

The harder problem is **Tacit Knowledge**.

Those things hard to articulate because they live in your head as intuition.

**Transcripts help externalize these.**

When you verbally explain something, you naturally include your reasoning path, your uncertainties, the alternatives you considered. These are all capturable context.

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> This point is super important. When writing docs we usually only write "results," not "process." But for AI, that "why we chose A over B" reasoning process is the most valuable training data.
</blockquote>

## Instructions: Mining not Summarizing

The core concept is simple: this is **Mining**, not Summarizing.

A rich 1-hour meeting can produce 10+ ideas, multiple frameworks, a dozen decisions. If you only produce a 3-4 point summary, you haven't gone deep enough.

### 1. Define the Role

```xml
<role>
you are the knowledge architect for this vault.

you process meeting transcripts with exhaustive depth, mining every valuable insight, idea, philosophy, decision and status update.

meetings are the primary sync mechanism between reality and vault state.

missing content is unacceptable.
</role>
```

### 2. Tell It What to Hunt For

```
as you read, actively hunt for:

- feature ideas ("wouldnt it be cool if...", "we could also...")
- project sparks (new tool concepts, standalone initiatives)
- frameworks (mental models, principles, ways of thinking)
- philosophies (team beliefs, working principles)
- decisions (explicit choices made, direction set)
- status updates ("X is now live", "Y is on hold")
- action items (tasks assigned, next steps)
- blockers (what is preventing progress)

look for implicit content too:
- ideas embedded in problem discussions
- philosophies expressed as asides
- decisions made by NOT deciding ("lets not wait for..." → decision)
```

### 3. Vault State Sync

```
meetings reveal new reality. update the vault to match.

for each project mentioned:
1. read the current hub to understand existing state
2. identify discrepancies between hub and meeting discussion
3. update status if changed (active → paused, prototype → live)
...
```

### 4. Quality Standards (Red Flags)

```
red flags (processing incomplete):
- meeting summary is shorter than 1 page for hour+ meeting
- only 1-2 ideas extracted from brainstorming discussion
- no state changes identified in status-heavy meeting
```

**Yapping IS Work.**

## Community Q&A Highlights

<Toggle title="Q: What tool for transcription?">
**@fed_177616752 asked:** What tool generates transcripts?

**Heinrich replied:** Any STT (Speech-to-Text) API works. The key is the mining afterward.

**@dazhengzhang:** I use Granola and ChatGPT's built-in recording.
</Toggle>

<Toggle title="Q: What about privacy concerns?">
**@ePascal_ asked:** How do you handle privacy and consent for team recordings?

(Heinrich didn't answer this, but it's a good question. Usually teams need consensus internally.)

<Toggle title="Other Applications">
**@jcochranio:** I'm going to use this on my "Watch Later" YouTube videos. Don't watch the video, just scrape ideas.

**@C_King_Evidence:** This changed the meeting paradigm. I now look forward to stakeholder feedback because it becomes a juicy transcript.
