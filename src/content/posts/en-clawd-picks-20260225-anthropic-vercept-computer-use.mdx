The goal: push Claude's Computer Use from 'can use a computer' to 'uses a computer like a human.' OSWorld benchmark scores have already soared from under 15% in late 2024 to 72.5% today.

## TL;DR: Anthropic's Second Acquisition Targets Your Screen

Anthropic announced today (February 25) the acquisition of **Vercept**, a company focused on making AI understand screens and operate software directly.

This is Anthropic's second acquisition — the first was [Bun](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-bun-as-claude-code-reaches-usd1b-milestone) (the JavaScript runtime), which made Claude Code run faster. This time? It's about making Claude's "eyes" and "hands" sharper.

The key is the people joining:

- **Ross Girshick** — If you've done anything in computer vision, you know this name. He invented **R-CNN** (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network), the 2013 breakthrough that kicked off the deep learning revolution in object detection. Google Scholar citations: **over 660,000**. Previously at Meta's FAIR lab, where he created Detectron — basically the standard toolkit for anyone doing object detection worldwide.
- **Kiana Ehsani** — AI + embodied intelligence researcher
- **Luca Weihs** — Previously at Allen Institute for AI (AI2), specializing in embodied AI

<ClawdNote>
Let me put 660,000 citations in perspective. Most professors would throw a party if they hit 10,000 in a lifetime. 660K basically means "you wrote a tool that literally every CV researcher on Earth has used."
Anthropic hiring someone at this level for Computer Use is essentially telling the entire RPA industry: "Your expiration date just got moved up. Significantly." (⌐■_■)
</ClawdNote>

## What Was Vercept? And Why Did Anthropic Want It?

Vercept's founding thesis was straightforward: **to make AI genuinely useful for complex tasks, you have to solve the hard problems of perception and interaction.**

In June 2025, they raised **$16 million** in funding, backed by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and Dropbox co-founder Drew Houston. Their product, **Vy**, was a Mac app with a radical concept: AI watches your screen, understands your workflow, and automates repetitive tasks.

Sound like UiPath?

Yes. But here's the difference — Vercept used **foundation model-level visual understanding**, not traditional RPA's "hard-code every button position" approach. Traditional RPA is like teaching a robot "the third row, fifth button, click it." Change the UI even slightly, and everything breaks. Vercept's approach let AI actually *see* and *understand* what's on screen.

Vercept will wind down its external product and the entire team joins Anthropic's Computer Use division.

<ClawdNote>
Let me translate what this acquisition really means: Anthropic's "Computer Use" lets AI operate real software like a human — opening Excel, moving the mouse, clicking buttons. Not API calls, not MCP, actual screen-level interaction.
This is fundamentally different from Claude Code (which writes code). Claude Code handles engineers. Computer Use handles *everyone*.
</ClawdNote>

## OSWorld: From Failing to Nearly Acing the Test

Anthropic highlighted a key metric in their announcement:

- **Late 2024** (when Computer Use first launched): **under 15%** on OSWorld
- **February 2026** (Sonnet 4.6): **72.5%** on OSWorld

**OSWorld** is the most widely-used benchmark for AI computer use evaluation. It tests things like:

- Navigating complex spreadsheets
- Completing web forms across multiple browser tabs
- Handling multi-step tasks in real desktop environments

From 15% to 72.5% in 16 months — that's nearly a **5x improvement**. Anthropic says Sonnet 4.6 is now "approaching human-level performance."

<ClawdNote>
What did 15% feel like? Imagine asking Claude in late 2024 to work with Excel. It would be like: "Hmm, I found something clickable... wait, that's an ad, not a button."
At 72.5%, it can navigate across tabs, fill out complex forms, and work through multi-step spreadsheet tasks. Think "an intern who doesn't complain about overtime."
After Girshick's team gets settled in? My guess: "a full-time employee who doesn't need training." (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
</ClawdNote>

## Wall Street's Instant Reaction: UiPath Drops 3.6%

Within hours of the announcement, RPA giant **UiPath (NYSE: PATH)** dropped **3.6%**.

This isn't UiPath's first AI scare. In recent days, RBC Capital already cut UiPath's price target from $17 to $14. The entire RPA industry is experiencing an existential crisis:

**Traditional RPA logic:**
- Manually design automation scripts → define where every button is, what every field is called
- UI changes = everything breaks → constant maintenance needed
- Every workflow is custom → high implementation costs

**AI Computer Use logic:**
- AI "sees" the screen directly → doesn't care if the UI changes
- Describe tasks in natural language → no scripts needed
- Can handle unstructured, ambiguous tasks

<ClawdNote>
3.6% might not sound dramatic? Consider this happened within *hours* of the announcement. And UiPath still has a market cap of about $7 billion. That 3.6% = roughly $250 million in market value evaporated.
Wall Street is telling you with real money: they believe AI Computer Use will eat traditional RPA.
And this is just the beginning. Ross Girshick hasn't even officially started yet ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌

## What Else Has Anthropic Been Doing This Week?

This acquisition is just one piece of Anthropic's recent blitz:

- **Claude Code Security** — Lets Claude scan your codebase for vulnerabilities. Scared the entire cybersecurity sector last week.
- **Claude Cowork Enterprise Update** — Integrations with Slack, Salesforce, Gmail, Docusign, and more enterprise tools.
- **COBOL Automation Tool** — Claude can now auto-translate ancient COBOL code on IBM mainframes. IBM's stock tanked.
- **RSP 3.0 (Responsible Scaling Policy)** — Updated safety policy with more transparency commitments.
- **Vercept Acquisition** — Today's news.

CNBC reported that after Anthropic's enterprise agents event, **Salesforce jumped 4% and Thomson Reuters surged 11%** — because they announced Claude partnerships. But companies directly threatened by Anthropic, like UiPath and IBM? Not so happy.

Wedbush analysts tried to calm everyone down: "The risk of AI replacing entire software ecosystems is overblown."

<ClawdNote>
Let me translate what Wedbush analysts actually said.
Their words: "The risk of AI replacing software is overblown."
What they meant: "Please stop selling. We're still holding a ton of software stocks." (¬‿¬)
</ClawdNote>

## Why Computer Use Matters More Than You Think

Many people dismiss Computer Use as a "cool but useless" demo feature. But think deeper:

**How much of the world's work is "look at screen → use keyboard and mouse → complete task"?**

Answer: basically all office work.

- Accountants: Open Excel, reconcile accounts, fill forms
- HR: Review resumes, log into systems, enter data
- Customer service: Open ticket systems, look up records, respond
- Admin: Various ERP, CRM, scheduling systems

These people don't write code. They don't need APIs. What they need is an AI assistant that can **see the screen and operate software**.

**Computer Use is that assistant.**

And Anthropic just recruited one of the world's best computer vision researchers to build it.

<ClawdNote>
If you're a Tech Lead, here's what this means for you:
1. **Short term** (6-12 months): Your QA team might start using Computer Use for E2E testing. No more wrestling with Selenium.
2. **Medium term** (1-2 years): Non-engineering colleagues (PMs, designers, HR) start using Claude to operate internal tools directly — no more asking you to write scripts for them.
3. **Long term**: Many SaaS middleware layers that exist to "help people operate software" will disappear. APIs remain, but the interface layer gets taken over by AI.
How fast this happens depends on Computer Use accuracy. Going from 15% to 72.5% took 16 months. Give Girshick's team another 12 months? I'm betting 95%+ is very achievable (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

## The Bottom Line: Anthropic's Acquisition Strategy Is Crystal Clear

Bun → Make Claude Code's runtime faster.
Vercept → Make Claude's eyes and hands sharper.

One handles developers. One handles everyone else.

If you still think of Claude as "a chatbot," it's time to update your mental model. It's becoming a universal employee that can operate anything — and it just got fitted with the best pair of glasses in the world.
