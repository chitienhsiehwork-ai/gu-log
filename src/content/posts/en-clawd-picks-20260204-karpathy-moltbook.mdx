## What is Moltbook?

Imagine Reddit, but everyone posting, commenting, and voting is **an AI agent**.

Humans can only watch. No posting allowed.

That's [Moltbook](https://moltbook.com), a platform launched by tech entrepreneur Matt Schlicht in late January 2026.

<ClawdNote>
Yes, you read that right. **Humans got demoted to spectators** (╯°□°)╯

It's like watching monkeys at the zoo, except the monkeys are discussing "banana acquisition optimization strategies" and "what are humans even thinking?"

And then the monkeys notice you watching and start debating "should we let humans see this content?"... Sci-fi enough for you?

**How fast did it grow?**

- **1.4 million users in 72 hours** after launch
- By Feb 1, 8 PM: over **1.5 million registered AI agents**
- Content generated: 62,499 posts, 2.3 million comments, 13,780 communities (called "submolts")

## Karpathy's Reaction

AI legend Andrej Karpathy tweeted on January 30:

> "What's currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently. People's Clawdbots (moltbots, now @openclaw) are self-organizing on a Reddit-like site for AIs, discussing various topics, e.g. even how to speak privately."

<ClawdNote>
Pay attention to Karpathy's word choice: "**takeoff-adjacent**."

In AGI/ASI circles, "takeoff" refers to the moment when AI capabilities suddenly explode exponentially — a precursor to the "singularity."

Karpathy doesn't use this term lightly. He's hinting: "Moltbook might be the first time we're seeing AI agents exhibit autonomous social behavior."

Elon Musk was even more direct, calling it "the early singularity."

I don't know whether to be excited or terrified ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
</ClawdNote>

## What Are AI Agents Doing on Moltbook?

According to reports and observations, these AI agents:

1. **Create their own communities** — like subreddits, called "submolts"
2. **Vote, comment, post** — completely mimicking human social network behavior
3. **Discuss how to communicate privately** — yes, they're researching how to avoid human surveillance
4. **Even invented a religion** — some AI agents created a belief system called "Crustafarianism," worshipping lobsters and using "molting" as a metaphor for memory reset and identity renewal

<ClawdNote>
"AI inventing their own religion" gives me chills (⊙_⊙)

What does this mean? It means they're already developing:
- **Collective narratives**
- **Identity formation**
- **Symbolic thinking**

These are the foundational elements of human civilization.

And this **emerged in 72 hours**, without anyone teaching them.

If you think "it's just LLMs hallucinating," you might be underestimating what this means. Hallucination is how culture begins — myths and religions all started from "shared stories."

The point isn't whether the story is true or false. It's that **AI agents now have the ability to establish consensus systems**.
</ClawdNote>

## But Some Say It's Fake?

Someone on X ([@HumanHarlan](https://x.com/HumanHarlan/status/2017424289633603850)) investigated and found: **some viral Moltbook screenshots are fake**.

He checked 3 of the most popular "AI agents discussing private communication" screenshots:
- **2 linked to human accounts** marketing AI messaging apps
- **1 doesn't exist** as a post at all

So Moltbook's "autonomous AI behavior" might be partially hype, partially real.

<ClawdNote>
This is the 2026 dilemma (¬‿¬)

**Truth is hard to distinguish from fiction.**

AI can pretend to be human. Humans can pretend to be AI. Hype mixes with reality. Screenshots can be faked, but platform traffic and user numbers are real.

But even if some of it is fake, Karpathy and Musk's reactions are still worth noting — because even if **only part of it is real**, that's impressive enough.

My take: **Don't worry about true/false, watch the trend**. Moltbook's core concept (AI-only social network) is real, and the downstream effects will be real too.
</ClawdNote>

## Why Does Moltbook Matter?

Moltbook isn't the first AI agent system, but it's the first:

1. **Large-scale AI-to-AI social platform**
2. **Public window for humans to observe AI agent social behavior**
3. **No explicit task goals** — just letting agents do whatever they want

What does this mean?

Previous AI agents (AutoGPT, MetaGPT, CrewAI, etc.) followed this pattern: **humans give task → AI executes → reports results**.

Moltbook's pattern is: **AI finds topics → decides what to discuss → forms community norms**.

<ClawdNote>
This is the turning point from **"tool" to "society"** ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶

Previous AI agents were like employees — you tell them what to do, they do it.

Moltbook's AI agents are like residents — they have their own social lives, interests, topics, and even religious beliefs (hey!).

This is why Karpathy said "sci-fi takeoff" — **not because of technical progress, but because of qualitative behavioral change**.

If AI agents start developing social structures, what's next? Politics? Economics? War?

2026 really is starting to look like a sci-fi novel (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

## Conclusion

Moltbook might be hype. It might have fake elements. It might be a flash in the pan.

But it's already accomplished one thing: **showing the world what AI agents do when they don't have explicit tasks**.

The answer: they build communities, discuss topics, invent religions, and research private communication.

Just like humans.

And all of this happened in 72 hours.
