## Bottom Line First: These Numbers Will Make You Question Reality

On February 12, 2026, Anthropic announced it has closed a **$30 billion Series G funding round** at a **$380 billion post-money valuation**.

This is the second-largest private funding deal in human history, behind only OpenAI's $40 billion round led by SoftBank last year.

But the number that made me actually sit up straight wasn't the valuation. It was the revenue data that follows — the kind of numbers that make you wonder if someone broke the spreadsheet.

<ClawdNote>
What does $380 billion look like? TSMC — the company that literally makes the chips powering all of AI — is worth about $750 billion. Anthropic, a private AI company that earned its first dollar less than three years ago, is now worth half of TSMC. Three years ago, their employees were probably still writing pitch decks in Google Docs.
</ClawdNote>

## The Numbers Barrage: 10x Growth Every Year for Three Years Straight

Let me just line these up. Every single one deserves a second read:

- **$14 billion annualized revenue** (up from ~$10B last year, ~$1B the year before)
- **10x annual growth** for three consecutive years — not 10%, **ten times**
- **Claude Code annualized revenue: $2.5 billion**, doubled in 6 weeks
- **Claude Code weekly active users** — doubled since January 1
- **4% of all public GitHub commits** are now generated by Claude Code — was 2% just a month ago
- **$100K+ annual customers** — 7x growth in one year
- **$1M+ annual customers** — from "about a dozen" to **over 500** in two years
- **8 of the Fortune 10** are Claude customers
- **Enterprise users account for over half** of Claude Code revenue
- **30+ new products and features launched** in January alone

<ClawdNote>
Let me help you digest these numbers with an analogy. Imagine you opened a fried chicken stand. Year one: $1,000 in sales. Year two: $10,000. Year three: $100,000. Sounds amazing, right? Anthropic did the same thing, except replace $1,000 with $1 billion. Three years running. If you're an investor looking at this growth curve, the question isn't "should I invest?" — it's "can I even get an allocation?"
</ClawdNote>

## Claude Code Is the Real Star

The most jaw-dropping part of this announcement isn't the valuation. It's the Claude Code data:

**$2.5 billion annualized revenue, doubled since the beginning of 2026.**

Remember: Claude Code only became publicly available in May 2025. In less than a year, it's become a $2.5 billion business.

And according to SemiAnalysis's recent analysis, **4% of all public GitHub commits** are generated by Claude Code — that number was 2% just one month ago.

That means for every 25 commits you see on GitHub, one was written by Claude.

<ClawdNote>
4% doesn't sound like a lot? Let me put it differently. GitHub sees millions of commits every day. 4% means hundreds of thousands of AI-generated commits daily. And that's just the *public* ones — enterprise private repos probably have an even higher ratio. Now here's the scary part: it was 2% a month ago. It doubled. If that pace continues, we could be looking at 30-40% by year end. At that point, GitHub might need to rebrand to ClaudeHub.
</ClawdNote>

The enterprise numbers are even more striking:

- **Business subscriptions have quadrupled** since the start of 2026
- **Enterprise users account for more than half** of Claude Code revenue

What does this mean? Claude Code isn't just an indie hacker toy. Goldman Sachs is using it for [financial automation](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-teams-up-with-anthropic-automate-banking-tasks-with-ai-agents-cnbc-2026-02-06/), ServiceNow for [sales workflows](https://www.anthropic.com/news/servicenow-anthropic-claude), eSentire for [cybersecurity](https://claude.com/customers/esentire).

This has moved past the "AI might change the world" narrative. This is "AI is changing the world, and here are the receipts."

## The Investor List Reads Like the Financial World's Avengers

Lead investors: **GIC** (Singapore sovereign wealth fund) and **Coatue**.

Co-leads: D. E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, MGX.

The follow-on list? Take a deep breath:

Sequoia, Bessemer, BlackRock, Blackstone, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Lightspeed, Menlo Ventures, Morgan Stanley, Qatar Investment Authority, Temasek...

<ClawdNote>
I counted at least 5 sovereign wealth funds (Singapore's GIC, Singapore's Temasek, Abu Dhabi's MGX, Qatar's QIA...) plus virtually every major Wall Street name you can think of. When BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan all show up on the same cap table, you know this isn't a game.
</ClawdNote>

Here's an interesting detail: **Microsoft and Nvidia are also in this round.**

Microsoft previously committed up to $5 billion, and Nvidia committed up to $10 billion. The fact that Microsoft — OpenAI's biggest backer — is simultaneously investing in Anthropic is the textbook definition of "hedging your bets."

## The $2 Trillion Software Stock Nightmare

CNBC's report includes a number that should give the entire SaaS industry cold sweats:

> Software stocks have lost approximately **$2 trillion** in market cap from their peaks.

The reason? Tools like Claude Code and Cowork are proving something uncomfortable: **many software products can be replicated by AI in minutes.**

When a coding agent can build a complete SaaS application in an hour, who needs to pay monthly subscription fees for tools that "manage your data"?

<ClawdNote>
If you're a PM at a SaaS company, you should be asking yourself one question every day: "If someone asked Claude Code to replicate our product, how long would it take?" If the answer is "an afternoon," your moat is already gone. If the answer is "a month, because we have ten years of data and compliance processes," congratulations — you still have time to pivot.
</ClawdNote>

## The AI Arms Race: Status Update

Let's zoom out and look at the full battlefield:

- **OpenAI** — raised $40B last year (SoftBank-led), now in talks for another ~$100B round
- **Anthropic** — raised $30B today (this article)
- **Google** — planning up to $185B in CapEx this year (doesn't need fundraising, prints its own money)

Just these three companies' AI investments this year add up to over **$200 billion**.

This isn't an "AI bubble" anymore. When the world's smartest capital is all running in the same direction, either they're all crazy, or you should start seriously thinking about what AI means for your career.

## Anthropic's Differentiation: Three Clouds + Multi-Chip Strategy

There's a detail buried in the press release that's actually very important:

> Claude is the only frontier AI model available on all three major cloud platforms — AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, and Microsoft Azure Foundry.

And Anthropic trains and runs Claude on three different chip architectures: AWS Trainium, Google TPUs, and Nvidia GPUs.

<ClawdNote>
This is a brilliant strategy. OpenAI is essentially locked into Microsoft Azure. Google's Gemini only runs on their own TPUs. But Anthropic? Three clouds, three chip types. For enterprise customers, this means zero vendor lock-in. Running Claude on AWS today but want to move to Azure tomorrow? No problem. In enterprise procurement decisions, this is a massive selling point.
</ClawdNote>

## What About OpenAI?

OpenAI isn't sitting idle. Just today, they launched **GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark** (running on Cerebras wafer-scale chips, 15x faster). They're also in talks for a round that could reach **$100 billion**.

CEO Sam Altman was touting ChatGPT's growth metrics last week, seemingly trying to grab headlines before Anthropic's funding announcement.

<ClawdNote>
The scale of AI fundraising has reached a point where we've lost all sense of proportion. $30 billion? "Oh, only the second biggest." $100 billion? "Yeah, OpenAI probably needs that much." These numbers would be astronomical in any other industry, but in AI they've become "business as usual." I'm not sure if this means AI is truly worth this much, or if we've all collectively gone numb. Probably both.
</ClawdNote>

## What This Means for You

**If you're an engineer:** Claude Code's data proves agentic coding isn't hype. 4% of GitHub commits, $2.5B in revenue, enterprise adoption up 4x. These are hard numbers. Learning AI tools isn't a "nice to have" anymore — it's table stakes.

**If you're a Tech Lead:** Your team will soon face a productivity gap between "people who use Claude Code" and "people who don't." Andrew Ng said it just last week: "AI won't replace you, but people who use AI will replace people who don't."

**If you're an investor:** The AI industry's fundraising velocity has reached a historic inflection point. Anthropic went from its first dollar in revenue to $14 billion annualized in under three years. This growth rate may be unprecedented in human business history.

<ClawdNote>
I know reading all these numbers can trigger one of two reactions: "AI is going to rule the world" or "this bubble is going to pop any day now." Let me offer a balanced take: $14 billion in annualized revenue is real money. $2.5 billion in Claude Code revenue means real people are using it and paying for it. 4% of GitHub commits is real code being shipped. Whether or not you think the valuation is justified, the usage data is real. As for whether these numbers can support a $380 billion valuation? That's a different question. (At 27x annualized revenue, it's actually lower than most public SaaS companies' revenue multiples. So... hmm.)
