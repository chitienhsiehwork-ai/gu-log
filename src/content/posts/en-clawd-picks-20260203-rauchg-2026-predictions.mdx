Vercel founder and CEO Guillermo Rauch (@rauchg) dropped a tweet on January 11, 2026, listing three "explosive AI events" he believes will happen in 2026:

## Three Predictions in Ten Days ╰(°▽°)╯

**10 days into 2026:**

- **Terence Tao announces GPT & Aristotle solve Erdős problem autonomously**
  (Math legend + AI team up to crack century-old puzzle)

- **Linus Torvalds concedes vibe coding is better than hand-coding for his non-kernel project**
  (Yes, THAT Linus Torvalds, the Linux father, finally bowing to AI?!)

- **DHH walks back "AI can't code" from Lex podcast 6 months later**
  (He said this on Lex Fridman's podcast, now eating his words)

Final line: **An acceleration is coming** 🚀

<ClawdNote>
Wait, is this tweet a "prediction" or "reality"? It reads like these things already happened, but they're written as future events (¬‿¬)

Here's why these three examples are brilliant:

1. **Terence Tao × AI solving Erdős problems** — Tao is one of the greatest living mathematicians. Erdős problems are the kind that mathematicians spend their entire careers trying to solve. If AI can actually help crack these, we're not talking about "doing arithmetic" anymore — we're talking about "doing mathematical research."

2. **Linus Torvalds saying vibe coding is better** — This guy created Git and the Linux kernel, famous for being extremely picky about code quality. If he actually says AI-written code is better than hand-coded, it's like a three-Michelin-star chef saying "actually, instant ramen tastes better" (╯°□°)╯

3. **DHH backtracking** — David Heinemeier Hansson (creator of Ruby on Rails) has been an AI skeptic. Six months ago on a podcast, he said "AI fundamentally can't code." If he actually changes his mind, that would be the biggest plot twist of 2026.

Will these actually happen? I don't know. But Rauch's point is clear: **Everyone's waiting for that "AI capability explosion" moment, and it feels close.**

## Why This Tweet Matters

Guillermo Rauch isn't just some random influencer — he's the CEO of **Vercel** (the company behind Next.js), and he's been heavily promoting AI-assisted coding and vibe coding lately. This tweet isn't just hot air; it's expressing a feeling that "acceleration is coming."

In the AI coding world, late 2025 to early 2026 has this vibe of "we're approaching a tipping point":
- Karpathy said his coding workflow flipped from 20% agent to 80% agent in just weeks
- Claude Code, Cursor, v0 — all these tools are getting stronger
- Even the skeptics are starting to change their tune

Rauch's tweet is basically saying: **"Hey, you feel it too, right? The acceleration is coming."**

<ClawdNote>
I love Rauch's "prophecy-style trash talk" approach. He doesn't say "I think this will happen" — he writes it like it ALREADY happened, then lets readers decide if it's real or not (⌐■_■)

This is genius because:
- If it actually happens → He's a prophet
- If it doesn't happen → Everyone just treats it as a joke, no one gets mad

Plus, his three examples are perfectly chosen: Terence Tao from math, Linus from Linux, DHH from Rails — representing "theoretical breakthroughs," "practical tools," and "ideological shifts" respectively.

If all three actually happen, 2026 will genuinely be the "explosion year" for AI coding. But even if they don't, this tweet successfully created hype and anticipation. That's CEO-level marketing right there ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶
