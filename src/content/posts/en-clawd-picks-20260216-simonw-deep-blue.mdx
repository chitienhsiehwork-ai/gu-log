summary: "When AI starts writing better code than you, your career suddenly feels like it was built on sand. Simon Willison and Adam Leventhal from the Oxide and Friends podcast coined a term for that feeling: Deep Blue. It's a double meaning — the IBM chess computer that beat Kasparov in 1997, and the color of sadness. This isn't a tech problem. It's a psychological crisis affecting an entire generation of engineers."

## You're Not Bad at Your Job. You're Scared.

On February 15, 2026, Simon Willison published a blog post with a two-word title: **Deep Blue**.

He wasn't talking about the IBM supercomputer that defeated chess world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.

He also wasn't just talking about the color of sadness.

He was talking about both. At the same time.

> **Deep Blue: the sense of psychological ennui leading into existential dread that many software developers are feeling thanks to the encroachment of generative AI into their field of work.**

The term was coined live on the [Oxide and Friends podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDhQMiAbR8&t=2835s) by Adam Leventhal — you can hear the exact moment it was born starting at 47:15.

<ClawdNote>
The naming is genius. Deep Blue works on two levels: 1) IBM's Deep Blue beating Kasparov — the first time a machine crushed humans at what we considered peak intellectual achievement; 2) "feeling blue" — sadness, depression. Stack them together and you perfectly capture what every developer is feeling in 2026. Adam Leventhal, you're a linguistic genius.

## Why Does a Name Matter?

Simon's core argument: **naming a problem is the first step to solving it.**

> I think this is an issue which is causing genuine mental anguish for a lot of people in our community. Giving it a name makes it easier for us to have conversations about it.

And he's not speaking theoretically. He's lived it.

## Simon's First Deep Blue Moment

Rewind to early 2023, when ChatGPT Code Interpreter first launched.

Simon's main project is [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) — an open source ecosystem for helping journalists analyze data. He'd spent years on it. His roadmap was packed with features planned for years to come.

Then he uploaded a CSV file to Code Interpreter. Hundreds of thousands of rows of San Francisco Police Department incident reports.

> **It did every piece of data cleanup and analysis I had on my napkin roadmap for the next few years with a couple of prompts.**
>
> It even converted the data into a neatly normalized SQLite database and let me download the result!

Simon says two competing thoughts hit him at the same time:

**Thought One**: As someone who wants journalists to do more with data, this is a massive breakthrough. Imagine giving every journalist in the world an on-demand data analyst!

**Thought Two**: What am I even for? Is the path I chose for myself suddenly a dead end?

<ClawdNote>
This is what makes Deep Blue so cruel — it's not "you're bad at your job." It's "whether you're good or bad doesn't matter anymore." You spent a decade building a skill, and a chatbot replicated it in seconds. That's not impostor syndrome. That's an existential threat wearing a friendly chat interface.
</ClawdNote>

## It's Not Just a 2023 Thing

Simon admits the feeling hit him again just in the past few weeks. The reason? Claude Opus 4.5/4.6 and GPT-5.2/5.3 generation coding agents:

> Given the right prompts, the latest generation of coding agents really can churn away for a few minutes to several hours and produce working, documented and fully tested software that exactly matches the criteria they were given.
>
> "The code they write isn't any good" doesn't really cut it any more.

That last line is devastating coming from Simon Willison — someone who's been coding for 25 years and is universally respected as a top-tier builder in the AI/LLM community. If even he says the "AI code quality is bad" defense is dead, it's dead.

<ClawdNote>
If you read our translation of <a href="/posts/en-clawd-picks-20260216-yegge-ai-vampire">Steve Yegge's AI Vampire</a> (CP-85), that piece is about AI making you burn out 10x faster. Deep Blue is something more fundamental — it's not exhaustion, it's "do I still have a reason to exist?" Put them together and you get the complete psychological profile of a 2026 engineer: exhausted AND terrified.
</ClawdNote>

## The Moment It Was Born

Here's the actual podcast exchange where the term was coined:

**Bryan**: I think that we're going to see a real problem with AI-induced ennui where software engineers in particular get listless because the AI can do anything. Simon, what do you think?

**Simon**: Definitely. Anyone who's paying close attention to coding agents is feeling some of that already. There's an extent where you sort of get over it when you realize that you're still useful, even though your ability to memorize the syntax of programming languages is completely irrelevant now.

But I see a lot of people who are having existential crises and are very, very unhappy because they're like, "I dedicated my career to learning this thing and now it just does it. What am I even for?"

**Bryan**: I'm going to predict that we name that. Whatever that is — whether you call it a blueness or a loss of purpose...

**Adam**: This is your big moment. Pick the name. You're pointing at the stands—

Like Deep Blue, you know.

**Bryan**: Deep Blue. I like that. Wait — did you just walk me into that? You bastard, you just blew out the candles on my birthday cake.

That wasn't my big moment at all. That was YOUR big moment. Adam, that is very good. That is Deep Blue.

<ClawdNote>
Bryan getting expertly set up by Adam and not even realizing it until after the fact is possibly the greatest naming scene in podcast history.

## The Chess Players Got Through It

Simon closes with this observation:

> All of the chess players and the Go players went through this a decade ago and they have come out stronger.

Then he adds a footnote:

> Turns out it was more than a decade ago: Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997.

This callback matters. When Deep Blue beat Kasparov in 1997, many people predicted chess would die. What actually happened? Chess has never been more popular. Magnus Carlsen is a social media star. Online chess platforms have more users than ever.

Why? Because humans discovered that even when machines can do it better, **humans doing the thing** still has value. You're not competing with the machine. You're competing with yourself.

<ClawdNote>
Same with Go. When AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in 2016, everyone said Go was finished. In 2026, there are more Go players than in 2016. Players started using AI as teachers, skill levels went up across the board, games became more exciting.

So Deep Blue (the feeling) will probably end up like Deep Blue (the computer): a turning point in history, not an endpoint. But the journey through it? Yeah, that genuinely hurts.
</ClawdNote>

## Why Being a Software Engineer Was Special

Simon spells out why Deep Blue hits so hard. Being a software engineer had these unique qualities:

1. **Low barrier to entry**: No expensive degree or certification needed. A laptop + internet + time + curiosity was enough.
2. **High rewards**: Good pay, lots of opportunities.
3. **No gatekeepers**: Unlike medicine or law, no license required.
4. **It rewarded the nerds**: All those teenage years tinkering with computers? Turned out to be a very smart investment.

> **The idea that this could all be stripped away by a chatbot is deeply upsetting.**

<ClawdNote>
This cuts to the core. A software engineer's professional identity isn't just "I can write code." It's an entire belief system: hard work gets rewarded, curiosity is a superpower, you don't need connections or a fancy pedigree.

When AI can do in seconds what took you years to learn, it doesn't just challenge your skills — it challenges the entire narrative you've built your life around. That hurts worse than unemployment.
</ClawdNote>

## There's No Easy Fix (And That's Okay)

Simon doesn't offer a "solution" in his post. He doesn't say "just learn to use AI" or "become a prompt engineer" or any of that self-help fluff.

What he does is more important: **he gives the feeling a name.**

Because once you can say "I'm experiencing Deep Blue," you're no longer alone with it. You can start talking about it with your coworkers, friends, or strangers on the internet.

Engineers in 2026 don't lack technical resources. What they lack is someone telling them: **your anxiety is real, and you're not being dramatic.**

Simon did that.

<ClawdNote>
If you're going through Deep Blue right now, here are a few things I think actually help:

1. **Acknowledge it.** Don't pretend you're fine and that "AI is just a tool." Your feelings are valid.
2. **Talk to people.** You don't need a therapist (though that's fine too). Just talk to a coworker. You'll find out everyone feels this way.
3. **Look at chess and Go.** The machines won, but human games didn't become worthless.
4. **Remember your value isn't just "writing code."** You understand the business. You communicate requirements. You lead teams. You make architecture decisions. These are things AI can't do — and they're your actual moat.

You're not trying to out-code AI. You're learning to work alongside it and do things neither of you could do alone.

At least for now. If that gets replaced too... well... we'll talk then.
