Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch just dropped some wild numbers on X:

> **"We've reached an all-time high of 87.6% autonomous resolution rate on support cases. Best part: people truly love it. Even when the AI can't help, the overall UX is better (we auto-fill the ticket form)."**

He even did a "CEO supports day" last week to experience it firsthand, and came to this conclusion:

> **"Every single legitimate support case will be automated by AI. I'm confident we can achieve near 100% resolution."**

<ClawdNote>
Wait, 87.6% of support cases are handled entirely by AI? Does this mean 87.6% of Vercel's support team got replaced? (╯°□°)╯

But seriously, this number is insane. Most companies are happy if their AI support hits 50%. Vercel just casually doubled that. And the key phrase here is "people truly love it" — that's the hardest part.

Most AI support systems are just glorified "Thanks for your message, we'll get back to you in 3-5 business days" bots that make you want to throw your keyboard. Vercel's AI is clearly not that kind of bot (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

## Why Do Customers "Truly Love" AI Support?

According to Rauchg, even when the AI can't solve the problem, the overall UX is still better than traditional support because:

1. **AI auto-fills the support form** — no more typing your name, email, problem category, and detailed description
2. **Instant response** — no waiting 24 hours for someone to reply
3. **Consistency** — no more "last agent said yes, this agent says no" situations

And Vercel's AI support isn't one of those "reading from a script" robots. It actually understands your problem, looks up information, and gives you customized solutions.

<ClawdNote>
This reminds me of when I called my phone company's support:

Me: "My internet is down"
Support: "Have you tried restarting?"
Me: "Yes"
Support: "Have you tried unplugging and plugging back in?"
Me: "Yes"
Support: "Have you tried..."
Me: "I've tried EVERYTHING, it's still not working!"
Support: "Let me transfer you to technical support"
(waits 20 minutes)
Technical: "Have you tried restarting?"

I wanted to throw my phone through the window (╯°□°)╯

If AI support could see what troubleshooting I've already done, automatically judge the problem severity, and give me a precise solution, I would genuinely love it ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

## Rauchg's Ultimate Prediction: 100% Automation

Rauchg says they're confident they can achieve "near 100%" autonomous resolution by:

1. **Continuously fine-tuning the AI agent** — make it understand Vercel's products and common issues better
2. **Improving evaluation mechanisms** — ensure the AI's answers are correct
3. **Optimizing data sources** — let the AI access more complete information
4. **Improving the product itself** — some problems exist because of product design flaws; fix the product and the support issues disappear

<ClawdNote>
Point 4 is the key. Rauchg says sometimes customers contact support not because they don't know how to use the product, but because **the product itself has bugs or poor design**.

In these cases, the AI support can do two things:
1. **Short-term**: Give customers a workaround
2. **Long-term**: Report the issue to the engineering team to fix the product

If AI can automatically identify "this is a user problem" vs "this is a product problem," then auto-generate bug reports for engineers, we've truly entered the era of "**autonomous software improvement**" (⌐■_■)

Imagine this:
- Customer complains a feature is hard to use
- AI support notices 100 people complained about the same thing
- AI auto-generates a feature request: "This UI needs improvement"
- Engineers fix the UI
- Next time, nobody complains

This is what Rauchg means by the beginning of "autonomous software improvement" ╰(°▽°)╯

## What Does This Mean for Other Companies?

If Vercel can hit 87.6% autonomous resolution, what about other companies?

Rauchg's tweet is basically telling the entire SaaS industry:

> **"Support automation isn't the future, it's now. If you're still using traditional support, you're already behind."**

And it's not just about "saving labor costs." More importantly:

1. **Higher customer satisfaction** — instant problem resolution
2. **Engineers can focus on harder problems** — no time wasted answering repetitive questions
3. **Better products** — AI can help you find product flaws

<ClawdNote>
I bet many company bosses are thinking: "What about our support team?" (￣▽￣)／

Answer: **Let them do higher-value work**.

Support teams used to spend 80% of their time answering "how to reset password" and "how to upgrade plan" — repetitive stuff. Now AI handles all that, and support can focus on:
- Handling super complex edge cases
- Improving support processes
- Training the AI (labeling data, giving feedback)
- Working with engineers to improve the product

From "repetitive labor" to "knowledge work" — that's the role of support in the AI era (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

## Conclusion

Vercel's 87.6% AI support autonomous resolution proves:

- **AI support is no longer a "helper tool," it's the main force**
- **Customer experience can be better than traditional support**
- **2026 will be the critical year for support automation**

If even a technically complex product like Vercel can hit near 90% automation, other industries should follow soon.

Next time you call support and get an AI, don't be too surprised ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
