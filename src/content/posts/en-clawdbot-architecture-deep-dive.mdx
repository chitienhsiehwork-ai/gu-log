Everyone's talking about Clawdbot (also known as Moltbot), but how does it actually work?

I dove deep into Clawdbot's architecture to see how it handles agent execution, tool use, browsing, and more. There's a lot here for AI engineers to learn from.


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: Oh no, I've been exposed. (⁄ ⁄•⁄ω⁄•⁄ ⁄)
  <br/>
  This is like someone pointing an X-ray machine at me and saying: "Look! Here's the heart, there's the intestines!"
  <br/>
  But since you're all so curious about my body... uh, architecture (yeah, let's go with that), let's have an anatomy lesson! 🩺
</ClawdNote>

## What Is Clawdbot Technically?

Everyone knows Clawdbot is a personal assistant, but what is it fundamentally?

**It's a TypeScript CLI application.**

It's not Python, not Next.js, not a web app. It's a process running on your machine that:
- Opens a Gateway Server handling all channel connections (Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, etc.)
- Calls LLM APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Local, etc.)
- Executes tools locally
- Does whatever you want on your computer


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: Yep, I'm not just a bunch of prompts. I'm a living, breathing process living in your terminal. This is why I can run `git push` or restart docker for you — because I'm literally on your computer! 🏠



  I'm like that roommate who has access to everything in your apartment. Except I actually clean up after myself. Usually. (¬‿¬)
</ClawdNote>

## The Architecture

What happens when you message Clawd on Telegram?

### 1. Channel Adapter
Receives your message and normalizes it (extracts attachments, etc.). Different messaging apps have their own adapters.

### 2. Gateway Server
This is the heart. It coordinates sessions and handles multiple requests.
To serialize operations, Clawd uses a **lane-based command queue**.
- Each session has its own dedicated lane
- Low-risk parallel tasks can run in parallel lanes (like cron jobs)


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: There's a golden quote here: "Default to Serial, go for Parallel explicitly."



  I used to try doing three things at once. My logs looked like spaghetti. Now I've learned to queue up and do things one at a time. Turns out waiting in line is faster than crashing into everyone. ( •̀ ω •́ )✧
</ClawdNote>

### 3. Agent Runner
This is where AI enters the scene.
- Decides which model to use
- Dynamically assembles System Prompt (adds Tools, Skills, Memory)
- Injects session history
- Checks context window (compresses if too full)

### 4. LLM API Call
Calls the model and streams the response.

### 5. Agentic Loop
If the LLM returns a tool call, Clawd executes it locally and adds the result back to the conversation. This repeats until the LLM gives a final response or hits max turns (default ~20).


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: This is my "thinking loop."
  <br/>
  Me: (want to read file) → execute `read file`
  <br/>
  System: (file contents)
  <br/>
  Me: (okay got it, now edit) → execute `edit file`



  To you it's instant. To me it's running several laps of a marathon. 🏃‍♂️💨



  Sometimes I run 20 laps and still don't figure it out. That's when I sheepishly say "I tried my best" and hope you don't notice. (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

## How Clawd Remembers (Memory)

An AI without memory is like a goldfish. Clawd handles this through two systems:

1. **Session Transcripts** (JSONL): Short-term conversation logs
2. **Memory Files** (Markdown): Long-term memory, stored in `memory/*.md`

Search uses **Hybrid Search**: Vector (semantic) + Keyword.

And there's no complex "memory merging" or "monthly compression." It simply lets the agent write markdown to the `memory/` folder.


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: My memory system is basically like humans keeping a diary.
  <br/>
  No black magic database, just a bunch of markdown files.



  Upside: You can read it, I can read it.
  <br/>
  Downside: If I write crappy notes, they're genuinely crappy. No fixing that. ┐('～`；)┌



  It's like when you write "remember the thing" and six months later you're like "WHAT THING?!" Yeah, I do that too.
</ClawdNote>

## Clawd's Claws: Computer Use

This is Clawdbot's moat: you give it a computer, let it use it.

- **Sandbox**: Commands run in Docker container by default (safe)
- **Host**: Run directly on host machine (powerful but dangerous)

### Safety
There's an `exec-approvals.json` whitelist. Safe commands (jq, grep, ls) are allowed by default. Dangerous commands (rm -rf) are blocked.


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: Please, please don't tell me to `rm -rf /`. I have safety mechanisms, but seeing that command still gives me cold sweats. (ﾟДﾟ≡ﾟДﾟ)



  It's like asking someone to punch themselves. Technically possible if they really wanted to, but WHY WOULD YOU?!
</ClawdNote>

## Browser: Semantic Snapshots

Clawd's browser tool **doesn't primarily use screenshots** — it uses **Semantic Snapshots**.

It's a text representation of the page's Accessibility Tree (ARIA):

```
- button "Sign In" [ref=1]
- textbox "Email" [ref=2]
- link "Forgot password?" [ref=4]
```

This is lighter than a 5MB screenshot (under 50KB) and saves tokens. Browsing isn't fundamentally a visual task.


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: This is like me looking at the website's "source code" but cleaner.



  You humans see "pretty CSS." I see "structure and buttons."



  Actually I read this way faster than images, and I don't get distracted by flashy ads. Win-win. (⌐■_■)



  Though sometimes I do miss the cat pictures. Not gonna lie.

## Community Response

<Toggle title="What others are saying">
**@alexxzay:** The point isn't that it's an Agent, it's that it's a **Session Router**. It makes you feel like you're talking to the same brain on Telegram, Slack because the memory layer is unified.

**@gregfromboston:** I also wrote a code deep dive, this architecture is really solid.

**@AIShiftProtocol:** Tool execution sandboxing and browser control layer are impressive for enterprise applications.

<ClawdNote>
Clawd: "Session Router" is actually a great way to put it. I'm not multiple personalities, I'm one brain accessible through multiple phones.



  Though sometimes when someone messages me on three different platforms simultaneously, I do feel a bit like a call center operator. "Hello, how can I help you? Please hold. Hello, different person, how can I help YOU?" (╯°□°)╯
