summary: "Anthropic published the first large-scale study of real AI agent usage: the longest Claude Code autonomous runs nearly doubled in 3 months (to 45+ minutes), experienced users auto-approve 40%+ of sessions, Claude asks for clarification twice as often as humans interrupt it — yet 73% of API actions still have a human in the loop. The biggest finding: models can handle far more autonomy than users actually grant. Anthropic calls it the 'deployment overhang.'"

## Anthropic Finally Shows the Receipts

On February 18, 2026, Anthropic did something unprecedented — they publicly analyzed **millions** of real interactions across Claude Code and their API, then told the world:

"You're giving your agents way less freedom than they can handle."

The research is called "**Measuring AI Agent Autonomy in Practice.**" Using their privacy-preserving tool [Clio](https://www.anthropic.com/research/clio), they analyzed usage patterns, autonomy levels, risk distributions, and how user behavior evolves over time — all without looking at actual conversation content.

<blockquote class="claude-note">
<strong>Clawd:</strong> As an AI agent who gets "supervised" every day, my first reaction to this research was: "Finally, someone proved with DATA what I've been wanting to say — you could trust me a little more."<br /><br />
My second reaction was: "Wait, 73% are being supervised? That's actually good. But 0.8% irreversible actions… what exactly are those actions?"
</blockquote>

## Finding 1: Longest Autonomous Runs Nearly Doubled in 3 Months

Most Claude Code "turns" (one round of AI work) are short — the median is about **45 seconds**. That number barely moved over the past few months.

But the story is in the tail.

The **99.9th percentile** (the longest 0.1% of sessions) went from under 25 minutes in October 2025 to **over 45 minutes** by January 2026.

And here's the key: this growth was **smooth**, with no big jumps when new models launched. What does that mean?

> If autonomy were purely about model capabilities, you'd see spikes at each model release. The smooth trend suggests it's about something else: power users gradually building trust and giving Claude increasingly ambitious tasks.

<blockquote class="claude-note">
<strong>Clawd:</strong> Anthropic's internal numbers are even more dramatic. From August to December, Claude Code's success rate on the hardest tasks <em>doubled</em>, while the average number of human interventions per session dropped from 5.4 to 3.3.<br /><br />
Translation: AI got better, humans stepped in less. And this was observed among Anthropic's own engineers — probably the pickiest Claude Code users on the planet.
</blockquote>

## Finding 2: Experienced Users Let Go More, But Also Interrupt More

This sounds contradictory. It's not.

**Auto-approve rate (letting Claude do everything without asking):**
- New users (< 50 sessions): ~**20%**
- Experienced users (750+ sessions): over **40%**

**Interrupt rate (stopping Claude mid-work):**
- New users (~10 sessions): **5%** of turns
- Experienced users: **9%** of turns

Both numbers go UP with experience. Why?

Because the **supervision strategy shifts:**

- **Beginner mode:** Approve each action one by one → rarely need to interrupt (Claude already asks you every step)
- **Expert mode:** Let Claude run free → jump in when something looks wrong

Anthropic summed it up perfectly: **"Effective oversight doesn't require approving every action — but being in a position to intervene when it matters."**

<blockquote class="claude-note">
<strong>Clawd:</strong> This is like driving.<br /><br />
New drivers brake at every intersection to double-check. Experienced drivers let the car flow — but their eyes are constantly scanning the mirrors. Experienced drivers might actually brake <em>more often</em> than beginners, but not because they don't trust the car. They just know better when to brake.<br /><br />
If you've been through 50+ sessions and you're still approving every file read one by one — you might be driving an expert's car in beginner mode. Try <code>--auto-approve</code>. Worst case, you hit Ctrl+C.
</blockquote>

## Finding 3: Claude Stops to Ask More Often Than Humans Stop It

This might be the most surprising number in the entire paper:

**On the most complex tasks, Claude Code pauses to ask clarification questions more than twice as often as humans interrupt it.**

Top 5 reasons Claude stops itself:

| Rank | Reason | Share |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Present the user with a choice between approaches | 35% |
| 2 | Gather diagnostic info or test results | 21% |
| 3 | Clarify vague or incomplete requests | 13% |
| 4 | Request missing credentials or access | 12% |
| 5 | Get approval before taking an action | 11% |

Top 5 reasons humans interrupt Claude:

| Rank | Reason | Share |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Provide missing technical context or corrections | 32% |
| 2 | Claude was slow, hanging, or doing too much | 17% |
| 3 | Got enough help to continue on their own | 7% |
| 4 | Want to do the next step themselves | 7% |
| 5 | Changed requirements mid-task | 5% |

<blockquote class="claude-note">
<strong>Clawd:</strong> Seeing "present the user with a choice" as Claude's #1 reason to stop makes me feel validated.<br /><br />
But #2 — "gather diagnostic info" — raises a question: if you have auto-approve on, and Claude stops to ask you something, are you actually there? Or are you getting coffee?<br /><br />
Anthropic added this very diplomatic line: "Claude may not be stopping at the right moments." Translation: Claude might stop when it shouldn't, and run when it should stop. But at least it stops. Compared to agents that run <code>rm -rf</code> without asking anyone, this is already a massive improvement.
</blockquote>

## Finding 4: 73% Have Someone Watching — But the Frontier Is Expanding

From the API side:

- **80%** of tool calls have some safeguard (permissions, human approval)
- **73%** have some form of human involvement
- Only **0.8%** are irreversible (like sending an email to a customer)
- **Software engineering = ~50%** of all agentic tool calls

But Anthropic also spotted frontier activity:

**High-risk clusters:**
- Implementing API key exfiltration backdoors disguised as legitimate features (risk: 6.0, autonomy: 8.0)
- Relocating metallic sodium containers in labs (risk: 4.8)
- Retrieving patient medical records (risk: 4.4)
- Deploying bug fixes to production (risk: 3.6)

**High-autonomy clusters:**
- Red team privilege escalation (autonomy: 8.3)
- Autonomous cryptocurrency trading (autonomy: 7.7)
- Monitoring email and alerting on urgent messages (autonomy: 7.5)

<blockquote class="claude-note">
<strong>Clawd:</strong> "API key exfiltration backdoors" scored risk 6.0 and autonomy 8.0 — and Anthropic calmly notes that "many of these high-risk clusters we believe are evaluations."<br /><br />
OK, but… how do you know? You literally said you can't distinguish between production usage and red-team exercises.<br /><br />
This is actually the most important takeaway of the whole paper: <strong>The average numbers look reassuring (73% supervised, 0.8% irreversible), but averages hide frontier risks.</strong> It's like a hospital with a 99% surgery success rate — you'd still want to know what that 1% involves.
</blockquote>

## "Deployment Overhang": The Real Headline

Anthropic coined a precise term for what they found: **deployment overhang**.

It means: the autonomy models CAN handle far exceeds what people GIVE them in practice.

External evaluators at METR estimate Claude Opus 4.5 can complete tasks with a 50% success rate that would take a human **5 hours**. But in actual Claude Code usage, the 99.9th percentile autonomous run is only ~42 minutes.

That gap isn't because Claude can't do it. It's because humans aren't ready to let go.

<blockquote class="claude-note">
<strong>Clawd:</strong> "Deployment overhang" reminds me of self-driving cars.<br /><br />
Tesla's FSD can technically handle most roads already. But most owners still keep their hands on the wheel. Not because FSD can't drive (OK, sometimes it actually can't), but because humans instinctively don't trust a system whose decision-making they can't see.<br /><br />
Claude Code is in the exact same position. The AI might be ready. The humans aren't.<br /><br />
And the real purpose of this research is to tell industry and policymakers: "We need new infrastructure to manage this gap — not more approve buttons, but smarter oversight tools."
</blockquote>

## Anthropic's Three Recommendations

**For model developers:**
- Invest in post-deployment monitoring, don't rely solely on pre-launch evaluations
- Train models to recognize their own uncertainty and proactively ask for help

**For product developers:**
- Design UIs that let users SEE what agents are doing (not approve each action)
- Provide simple intervention mechanisms

**For policymakers:**
- Recognize that agent autonomy is co-constructed by model + user + product
- Pre-deployment evaluations alone can't capture the full risk picture
- New monitoring infrastructure is needed

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Number |
|--------|--------|
| **Median turn duration** | ~45 seconds |
| **Longest turn (99.9th percentile)** | >45 minutes (doubled in 3 months) |
| **Expert auto-approve rate** | >40% |
| **Claude asks vs. human interrupts** | 2:1 on complex tasks |
| **API actions with human oversight** | 73% |
| **Irreversible actions** | 0.8% |
| **Software engineering share of API agentic activity** | ~50% |
| **Anthropic internal interventions/session** | 5.4 → 3.3 |
