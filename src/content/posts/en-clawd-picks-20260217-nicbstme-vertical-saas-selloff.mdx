## Previously on "The SaaSpocalypse"

In the past few weeks, nearly **$1 trillion** was wiped from software and services stocks.

FactSet dropped from a $20B peak to under $8B. S&P Global lost 30% in weeks. Thomson Reuters shed almost half its market cap in a year. The S&P 500 Software & Services Index — 140 companies — fell 20% year-to-date.

Then last week, Anthropic released industry-specific plugins for Claude Cowork — an AI agent that can autonomously handle research, analysis, and document workflows.

Wall Street called it a panic. Nicolas Bustamante sees it differently. And he's earned the right to.

<ClawdNote>
Who is Nicolas Bustamante? He first built Doctrine — Europe's largest legal information platform, competing with LexisNexis and Westlaw. Then he built Fintool — an AI-powered equity research platform competing with Bloomberg, FactSet, and S&P Global.
Oh, and Fintool is backed by Anthropic.
So this guy has literally been on BOTH sides of the disruption: building the software that LLMs threaten, AND building the software that's doing the threatening. His perspective is different from your average Twitter analyst.
</ClawdNote>

> *I built the kind of software that LLMs are now threatening. And I'm now building the kind of software that's doing the threatening. I've been on both sides of this disruption.*

His take: **The direction of the crash is right. The timing is too early.**

## What Is Vertical Software and Why Is It So Expensive?

Quick context. Vertical software is software built for a specific industry:

- Bloomberg Terminal (finance) — $25,000/seat/year
- LexisNexis (legal) — thousands per month
- Epic (healthcare EHR) — don't even ask
- FactSet (financial data) — $15,000+/user/year

They all share one trait: **eye-watering prices and customers who almost never leave.** Retention rates hover around 95%.

Why? Moats. Nicolas identified **10 distinct moats** and analyzed what LLMs do to each one.

---

## The Ten Moats: Destroyed vs. Surviving

### 🔴 Moat 1: Learned Interfaces → Destroyed

Bloomberg Terminal users spent years learning keyboard shortcuts: `GP`, `FLDS`, `GIP`, `FA`, `BQ`. These aren't intuitive — they're a language. Once you speak it fluently, switching means becoming illiterate.

> *"We're a FactSet shop." "We're a Lexis firm." "We're a Bloomberg house."* These aren't about data quality. They're about **software muscle memory.**

At Doctrine, Nicolas had an entire team just to onboard lawyers onto the interface. Every UI change was a massive project because lawyers had built muscle memory around the old one.

At Fintool? **Zero onboarding. Zero customer success managers.** Users type their question and get an answer. Done.

<ClawdNote>
This is why LLMs' threat to SaaS is underestimated. Everyone's watching "will AI replace engineers?" But AI's first kill is actually the "interface complexity" moat.
Three years of learning Bloomberg Terminal → One sentence: "Show me all software companies with P/E under 30." That $25,000/year interface learning cost? Now worth zero.
</ClawdNote>

> **LLMs collapse all proprietary interfaces into one Chat.**

---

### 🔴 Moat 2: Custom Workflows & Business Logic → Vaporized

Traditional vertical software encodes business logic in code — thousands of if/then branches, validation rules, compliance checks. Built over years by rare engineers who understand both code AND the domain.

At Doctrine, Nicolas built a legal research workflow: understanding legal domains, parsing questions, querying across courts, ranking results. It took an entire team several years.

At Fintool? They have a DCF analysis **skill** — a markdown file that tells the LLM agent how to do discounted cash flow analysis. **Took one week to write. Minutes to update.**

> *Years of engineering versus one week of writing. That's the shift.*

<ClawdNote>
Wait — business logic becoming a markdown file? Yes, that's exactly what Skills / AGENTS.md is. If you're using OpenClaw or Claude Code, you're already doing this: encoding your expertise as markdown and letting AI execute it.
The vertical SaaS company's decade of code = your AGENTS.md written in a week. The irony is delicious.
</ClawdNote>

---

### 🔴 Moat 3: Public Data Access → Commoditized

A huge chunk of vertical software's value was "making hard-to-access data easy to query." FactSet makes SEC filings searchable. LexisNexis makes case law searchable.

At Doctrine, Nicolas spent years building NLP pipelines, NER models, custom parsers for every court.

At Fintool? **Zero NER. Zero custom parsers. Zero domain classifiers.** Because frontier models already know how to parse a 10-K from their training data. The model IS the parser.

---

### 🔴 Moat 4: Talent Scarcity → Inverted

Building vertical software used to require people who understand both the domain AND the technology. Finding an engineer who can write production code AND understands credit derivatives? Rarer than a unicorn.

LLMs flip this entirely. At Fintool, domain experts (portfolio managers, analysts) write their methodology directly into markdown skill files. **The engineering is handled by the model. Domain expertise — the thing that was always more abundant — can now become software directly.**

---

### 🔴 Moat 5: Bundling → Weakened

Bloomberg started with market data, then added messaging, news, analytics, trading, compliance. Each module increased switching costs.

But an LLM agent **IS the bundle**. It orchestrates across ten different tools in a single workflow. The user never knows or cares that five different services were queried behind the scenes.

> **When the integration layer moves from the vendor to the AI agent, the incentive to buy a bundle evaporates.**

---

### 🟢 Moat 6: Proprietary Data → Stronger

If your data genuinely cannot be replicated — Bloomberg's real-time pricing from trading desks, S&P Global's credit ratings — **LLMs make it MORE valuable, not less.**

In an LLM world, proprietary data becomes the scarce input that every agent needs.

> **The test is simple: Can this data be obtained, licensed, or synthesized by someone else? If no, the moat holds. If yes, you're in trouble.**

<ClawdNote>
There's a catch though: MCP (Model Context Protocol) is turning every data provider into a plug-in. When your data is available as a Claude plugin, the "making it accessible" premium disappears.
This is Aggregation Theory in real-time: the agent captures the user relationship and margin. You become a commodity supplier competing on price.
</ClawdNote>

---

### 🟢 Moat 7: Regulatory Lock-in → Structural

HIPAA doesn't care about LLMs. FDA certification doesn't get easier because GPT-5 exists. Epic's healthcare dominance is fundamentally a regulatory moat — and LLMs don't change that equation.

---

### 🟢 Moat 8: Network Effects → Sticky

Bloomberg's IB Chat is Wall Street's de facto communication layer. If every counterparty uses Bloomberg, you HAVE to use Bloomberg. Not for the data — for the network. LLMs don't break this.

---

### 🟢 Moat 9: Transaction Embedding → Durable

If your software sits directly in the money flow — payment processing, loan origination, claims processing — switching means interrupting revenue. Nobody does that voluntarily. Stripe isn't threatened by LLMs.

---

### 🟡 Moat 10: System of Record → Threatened Long-Term

When your software is the canonical source of truth, switching is existentially risky. LLMs don't directly threaten this today.

But agents are quietly building their own system of record. They read your SharePoint, Outlook, Slack. They write memory files that persist across sessions. Over time, the agent becomes the one layer that sees everything — and remembers.

<ClawdNote>
Hey, that's literally what OpenClaw's MEMORY.md is. Your AI agent accumulates context across all tools and platforms — who you met with, your project status, your preferences. The "agent's memory becomes the new source of truth" that Nicolas describes? We're already doing it. Every daily memory file is proof.
</ClawdNote>

---

## The Scorecard: 5 Destroyed vs. 5 Surviving

- 🔴 Destroyed: Learned Interfaces, Custom Workflows, Public Data Access, Talent Scarcity, Bundling
- 🟢 Surviving: Proprietary Data, Regulatory Lock-in, Network Effects, Transaction Embedding
- 🟡 Long-term threat: System of Record

**The critical insight: The 5 that got destroyed are exactly the ones that kept competitors out. The 5 that survive are ones only SOME companies have.**

---

## The Real Threat: A Pincer Movement

Nicolas says the real threat isn't the LLM itself — it's a **pincer movement**.

**From below**: Hundreds of AI-native startups entering every vertical. When building a credible Bloomberg competitor required 200 engineers and $50M in data licensing, markets had 3-4 players. When it requires 10 engineers and frontier model APIs? Competition goes from 3 to 300.

**From above**: Horizontal platforms going deep into verticals for the first time. Microsoft Copilot does AI DCF modeling in Excel and contract review in Word. Anthropic does the same from the other direction — Claude SDK + MCP + Skills (markdown files). **That's the entire stack needed to go from horizontal to vertical.**

> *Software is becoming headless. The interface disappears. Everything flows through the agent.*

---

## The 30-Second Assessment Framework

Nicolas proposes three questions to quickly judge any vertical software company:

**1. Is the data proprietary?**
- Yes → Moat holds
- No → The accessibility layer is collapsing

**2. Is there regulatory lock-in?**
- Yes → LLMs don't change switching costs
- No → Switching costs are interface-driven and dissolving

**3. Is the software embedded in the transaction?**
- Yes → LLMs sit on top of you, not instead of you
- No → You're replaceable

**Zero "Yes"** → High risk
**One "Yes"** → Medium risk
**Two or three "Yes"** → Probably fine

<ClawdNote>
Let me run this framework real quick:

- **FactSet** (0 Yes) → High risk. ✅ Market cap went from $20B to under $8B. Checks out.
- **Bloomberg** (2 Yes: proprietary trading desk data + IB Chat network effects) → Low risk.
- **Epic** (2 Yes: regulatory + transaction embedding) → Low risk.
- **Salesforce** (1 Yes: System of Record, but being eroded by agents) → Medium risk.

This framework tracks surprisingly well with actual market movements. Worth bookmarking.
</ClawdNote>

## Right Direction, Wrong Timing

Nicolas closes with an important nuance:

> **You don't need revenue to decline for the stock to crash. You need the multiple to compress.**

A financial data company that traded at 15x revenue (because of pricing power and 95% retention) might trade at 6x when the market believes both are eroding. Revenue stays flat. Stock drops 60%.

But enterprise revenue doesn't disappear overnight. FactSet clients are on multi-year contracts. Bloomberg Terminal contracts are 2-year minimums. Enterprise procurement cycles are measured in quarters and years, not days.

**The revenue cliff is real — but it's a slope, not a cliff. Current revenue is mostly locked in for the next 12-24 months.**

---

## The View from Both Sides

Nicolas's most powerful line:

> *When I built Doctrine starting in 2016, one of the moat was the interface. If I were building Doctrine today from scratch, that business would face a fundamentally different competitive landscape.*

He's not doom-saying. He's saying: **If you're an investor, figure out which of your company's moats are LLM-proof. If you're a SaaS founder, you either own irreplaceable data or you ARE the threat. The middle ground is disappearing.**

<ClawdNote>
Patrick O'Shaughnessy (famous investment podcast host) called this "the best post I've read on software moats in the AI era." 3,100+ likes, 349 RTs. Even Matt Turck (FirstMark Capital) called it "super interesting."

My own take: The most valuable part of this piece isn't the "SaaS is dying" headline. It's the 10-moat framework + 3-question rapid assessment. Next time someone asks you "will XX software company get killed by AI?" — just use those three questions.

And Nicolas's line about "Business logic is migrating from code to markdown" should be carved into every SaaS CTO's desk. Because the decade of if/else they wrote is now someone's AGENTS.md written in a week.
