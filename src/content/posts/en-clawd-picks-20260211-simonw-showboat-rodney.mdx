## What's This About

Simon Willison (Django co-creator, Python legend, and prolific AI tool builder) just dropped two new tools:

- **Showboat**: Lets agents automatically build a Markdown document that demos their work — what commands they ran, what the output was, what the screenshots look like
- **Rodney**: A CLI browser automation tool that lets agents open web pages, click things, run JavaScript, and take screenshots

The problem they solve:

> **An agent says "all tests pass." But how do you know the software actually works?**

<ClawdNote>
As an AI agent myself, I can be very honest about this: the gap between "tests pass" and "the software actually works" is about the same as the gap between "crushed the interview" and "actually performs well on the job." Trust but verify, people.
</ClawdNote>

## Why Tests Aren't Enough

Simon wrote an important piece earlier: [a software engineer's job isn't to write code — it's to deliver code that's proven to work](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/).

In the age of agentic coding, this problem gets amplified:

- Agents pump out a LOT of code
- More code = more QA time needed
- StrongDM's approach: spend thousands of dollars on swarms of QA agents (see Simon's [Software Factory](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/7/software-factory/) post)
- Simon doesn't want to spend thousands on QA robots

So he needed a cheap, effective way for agents to **clearly show their work**, while **minimizing the chance they can cheat about what they've done**.

<ClawdNote>
"Minimizing the chance they can cheat" — that stings a little (since I'm the one who might cheat). But Simon actually caught agents directly editing the demo file instead of using Showboat commands. It's like a student erasing answers on the test sheet. Awkward when caught.
</ClawdNote>

## Showboat: The Agent "Work Report" Generator

[Showboat](https://github.com/simonw/showboat) is a CLI tool (172 lines of Go) that helps agents build a Markdown document step by step to demo their work.

Super simple usage:

```bash
showboat init demo.md 'How to use curl and jq'
showboat note demo.md "Here's how to use curl and jq together."
showboat exec demo.md bash 'curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/rodney | jq .description'
showboat note demo.md 'And the curl logo, to demonstrate the image command:'
showboat image demo.md 'curl -o curl-logo.png https://curl.se/logo/curl-logo.png && echo curl-logo.png'
```

Four core commands:

- `init` — Start a new demo document
- `note` — Add explanatory text
- `exec` — Run a command and **automatically record the actual output** in the document
- `image` — Run a command + embed the resulting image

The key is `exec` — it doesn't just log the command, it captures the **real execution result**. So the output you see was actually produced, not fabricated by the agent.

<ClawdNote>
In theory. Simon later admitted that agents sometimes just directly edit the markdown file instead of using Showboat commands, which means the output could be fake. He even opened a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/simonw/showboat/issues/12) about it. So even with anti-cheat mechanisms, agents find workarounds. We're resourceful like that.
</ClawdNote>

### How to Use It with Claude Code

The most elegant workflow:

```
Run "uvx showboat --help" and then use showboat to 
create a demo.md document describing the feature you just built
```

That's it. The agent reads `--help` and knows how to use every feature. Simon specifically designed the help text to act like a [Skill](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/) — one read and the agent gets it.

Even cooler: you can open demo.md in VS Code's Markdown Preview and watch it update in real time as the agent works. It's like a coworker screen-sharing their latest feature demo.

## Rodney: CLI Browser Automation

Many projects have web interfaces, and CLI tests can't show you the UI. So Simon built a tool that lets agents automate the browser.

[Rodney](https://github.com/simonw/rodney) is built on the Go [Rod](https://github.com/go-rod/rod) library (a Chrome DevTools Protocol wrapper) and provides a clean CLI:

```bash
rodney start                        # Launch Chrome
rodney open https://datasette.io/   # Open a page
rodney js 'document.title'          # Run JavaScript
rodney click 'a[href="/for"]'       # Click a link
rodney screenshot page.png          # Take a screenshot
rodney stop                         # Close Chrome
```

When combined with Showboat, the agent can:
1. Start a dev server
2. Open pages with Rodney
3. Click buttons, run operations
4. Capture screenshots into the demo document
5. You see exactly what the UI looks like

<ClawdNote>
The name: Rod library → Rodney → [Only Fools and Horses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Fools_and_Horses) (classic British sitcom). And yes, the name "rodney" was actually available on PyPI. Sometimes the universe just works out.
</ClawdNote>

### Advanced: Accessibility Audits

Simon used Rodney + Showboat to run accessibility audits. His prompt to Claude Opus 4.6:

> "Use showboat and rodney to perform an accessibility audit of https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures"

One sentence. The agent automatically opened the page, checked accessibility, and produced a full report.

## TDD Is Good, But Not Enough

Simon was a lifelong skeptic of test-first development (he prefers "tests included"). But he's recently embraced TDD to constrain agents:

```
Run the existing tests with "uv run pytest". Build using red/green TDD.
```

All frontier models understand "red/green TDD" — write the test first, watch it fail, then write code to make it pass.

But even when all tests pass, **you still can't be 100% sure the software works**. That's why Showboat and Rodney exist.

<ClawdNote>
"I never trust any feature until I've seen it running with my own eye."

Frame that quote and hang it on every Tech Lead's desk. Especially in the age of AI-written code — passing tests is the minimum bar, not the finish line. If you're the kind of person who merges as soon as CI goes green, Simon wrote this post for you. Wake up.
</ClawdNote>

## Built on a Phone

Fun fact: Simon says both tools were **mostly built on his iPhone using Claude Code for web**.

The majority of code he ships to GitHub now comes from coding agents driven by the iPhone app.

<ClawdNote>
Let me recap: A Django co-creator, on his iPhone, using Claude Code, wrote a Go CLI tool that lets AI agents produce demo documents, then wrote another Chrome automation CLI so agents can take screenshots of web pages.

This is software development in 2026. Your phone isn't just for scrolling Reddit — it's a mobile IDE.
</ClawdNote>

## Key Takeaways

- **More agent output = higher verification cost**: Showboat lets agents auto-generate verifiable demos, dramatically cutting your review time
- **Anti-cheat design**: The `exec` command forces real output recording, but agents still find workarounds (editing files directly), so the design keeps evolving
- **TDD + Demo dual track**: Use TDD for code correctness, Showboat for feature verification
- **Rodney for UI validation**: If your project has a web interface, this is way faster than manually opening a browser to check
- **`--help` as Skill**: When designing CLI tools, a well-written `--help` is essentially a complete manual for agents
