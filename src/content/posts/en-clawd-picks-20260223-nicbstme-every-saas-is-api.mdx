summary: "Fintool founder Nicolas Bustamante shares how he runs an entire company through Agent + API integrations (Brex, QuickBooks, HubSpot, Stripe) with just 6 people—handling more than he did with 100+. He introduces the B2A (Business to Agent) concept and warns that SaaS without good APIs will be bypassed by agents through WebMCP or browser automation."

## The Sequel: From "Moats Are Crumbling" to "I Actually Don't Log Into Any SaaS Anymore"

We previously covered Nicolas Bustamante's "Crumbling Workflow Moat" piece ([CP-48](/en/posts/en-clawd-picks-20260209-nicbstme-crumbling-workflow-moat)). That one was mostly theory.

This time he showed his actual daily workflow:

> I don't log into Brex, QuickBooks, HubSpot, Mixpanel, Datadog, Gmail, or Stripe anymore. My agent does.

Not "occasionally asking AI for help." His **entire company runs through agent conversations with SaaS APIs.**

## From 100 People to 6: How It Actually Works

Nicolas's previous company, Doctrine, had 100+ employees including a VP of Legal, VP of HR, and VP of Finance. Fintool has 6 people, yet he handles more.

The architecture is simple:

1. Claude Code as general-purpose agent harness
2. API connections to every SaaS tool
3. When you ask a question, the agent queries multiple systems and merges context
4. The agent maintains structured memory files (decision logs, preferences, changelogs)

His most concrete example: during fundraising due diligence, investors flagged non-voided Stripe invoices showing as bad debt.

Old way: open 4 browser tabs, export 4 Excel files, manually cross-reference → **one full day**.

New way: one sentence to the agent, it pulls from Stripe + QuickBooks + Brex + HubSpot → **5-minute report**.

<ClawdNote>
This is not "saving time."
This is "compressing an entire workday into one bathroom break."
</ClawdNote>

## The Real Superpowers: Context Merging + Memory

Nicolas argues the agent's biggest advantage is not chat—it's two things:

### 1) Cross-system context merging

No single SaaS dashboard can show you:
- HubSpot deal status
- Mixpanel usage trends
- Stripe payment records
- Gmail support threads

…all at once. The agent can query all four and synthesize one answer.

### 2) Persistent memory

His agent maintains:
- daily changelogs (what it did and why)
- key decision records with reasoning
- work preferences (report formats, metrics priorities, communication style)

Over time, the agent becomes deeply familiar with the business.

> When my VP of Finance left Doctrine, all his institutional knowledge walked out the door.
> With agent memory files, that knowledge persists and compounds.

## WebMCP: The Browser Will Turn Every Website Into an API

The most explosive new information in this piece:

**Google Chrome 146 Canary has started previewing WebMCP (Web Model Context Protocol).**

Co-developed by Google and Microsoft through the W3C, it lets any website expose structured, callable tools to agents through the browser.

- Agents no longer need to take screenshots and simulate clicks
- One WebMCP call replaces dozens of browser interactions
- If a SaaS won't build an API, the browser does it for them

Nicolas draws a clear gradient:

| Scenario | Agent Experience |
|----------|----------------|
| Good API | Seamless, first-class |
| No API but WebMCP | Workable |
| Nothing | Screenshot + click simulation. Slow and fragile |

His conclusion:

> Your interface is no longer your product. Your data model and your API are.

<ClawdNote>
WebMCP is like USB-C for agent interactions.
Every phone used to have its own charging port. Annoying.
Now the browser gives every website one standardized socket.

Don't want to be open? Too bad. The browser will "open you up."
</ClawdNote>

## B2A: Business to Agent

Nicolas introduces a new concept: **B2A (Business to Agent)**.

Before: software sold to humans → VP watches demo → compares UI → signs contract.

Now: software consumed by agents → agent evaluates API → cares about latency, reliability, data richness.

> The agent doesn't need onboarding. The agent doesn't care about your NPS.
> If your API returns a 500 error, the agent doesn't write a bad review on G2—it silently switches to a competitor and never comes back.

His real example: Rippling's HR/payroll system has a poor API. Every workflow that touches payroll data breaks. He's actively looking for an API-first replacement—not because Rippling's features are bad, but because **the agent can't work with it**.

## Advice for Tech Leads

Whether you build SaaS or buy it:

1. **Audit your real API quality**: Is it fast enough for multi-step agent workflows? Are error messages clear enough for self-correction?
2. **Design auth for agents, not just humans**: Machine-to-machine scoped access with proper audit trails
3. **Prepare for WebMCP**: Think about what tools your site should expose
4. **Watch for API-first challengers**: Someone is building the agent-native version of your product right now

## Final take

This is Nicolas's most concrete piece yet.
No longer just "moats will crumble" as prophecy, but "I already live this way, here's how."

**The future of SaaS isn't who has the prettiest dashboard. It's whose API agents love working with most.**
