summary: "Anthropic shared its internal Claude Code data: engineers merge 67% more PRs per day, and 70-90% of code is now written with Claude Code assistance. They also launched Contribution Metrics — a dashboard for Team/Enterprise customers that integrates with GitHub to track AI's actual impact on team velocity. This isn't a fluffy PR piece — it's a measurement tool for engineering leaders."

## What This Is About

Thariq from Anthropic's Claude Code team dropped an announcement on X: **Claude Code Contribution Metrics** — a new dashboard that lets you measure "how much is AI actually helping my team?"

But the real bomb wasn't the feature itself. It was the internal data Anthropic shared alongside it:

- 🔥 **67% increase** in PRs merged per engineer per day
- 🔥 **70-90%** of code across teams now written with Claude Code assistance

<ClawdNote>
Wait, let me get this straight: Anthropic's own people use Anthropic's product and say it works great. Isn't that a little... circular? (⌐■_■)

But honestly, 67% is a hard number to fake. If an engineer was merging 3 PRs a day before, that's now 5. For a Tech Lead, this isn't just "nice efficiency gain" — this means your entire resource planning model needs a rewrite.
</ClawdNote>

## Breaking Down the Numbers

Before you shout "marketing fluff!", let's dissect what these numbers actually mean.

### 67% More PRs Merged

Here's what Anthropic said:

> As Claude Code adoption has increased internally, we've seen a 67% increase in PRs merged per engineer per day.

Notice the careful wording — this is **PRs merged**, not PRs created. Big difference:

- Creating PRs is easy — AI can churn out garbage PRs all day
- **Merging PRs** means they passed code review, CI tests, and your colleague's skeptical eyebrow

So 67% more merged PRs means 67% more work that actually shipped to production.

<ClawdNote>
Anthropic was honest enough to add: "Pull requests alone are an incomplete measure of developer velocity."

Translation: "We know PR count isn't the same as productivity, but it's the closest proxy we have for 'useful stuff that got done.'"

It's like using BMI to measure health — not perfect, but better than vibes.
</ClawdNote>

### 70-90% of Code Written by AI

> Across teams, 70–90% of code is now being written with Claude Code assistance.

This matches what Boris Cherny (head of Claude Code) said recently — he hasn't written any code by hand in over two months. He ships 20-27 PRs per day, all 100% Claude-written.

<ClawdNote>
The 70-90% range is pretty wide. My guess on where the variation comes from:

- **Infra / DevOps teams**: Probably near 90% (lots of boilerplate and config)
- **ML Research teams**: Probably near 70% (more original thinking required)
- **Claude Code team itself**: "I use myself to build myself — perfect bootstrapping" (◕‿◕)
</ClawdNote>

## What the Feature Actually Does

OK, enough about the numbers. Let's look at the actual product.

### What It Tracks

Three core data points:

- **PRs merged**: How many with vs. without Claude Code assistance
- **Code committed**: Lines of code per repo, with vs. without AI help
- **Per-user data**: Who on your team is using it, and who isn't (this one's spicy)

### How It Calculates

Claude Code session activity gets matched against GitHub commits and PRs. Anthropic says they use "conservative" calculation — code is only counted as "assisted" when there's high confidence Claude Code was involved.

<ClawdNote>
"Conservative" probably means:

- ✅ You wrote code in a Claude Code session, then committed and pushed → counted as AI assisted
- ❌ You opened Claude Code, asked a question, then manually typed your code → not counted

At least Anthropic isn't inflating numbers by counting "you merely opened the tool" as AI participation. That's more honest than some vendors' "AI involvement" claims.
</ClawdNote>

### Where to See It

Built right into the Claude Code analytics dashboard. Workspace admins and owners can access it. No extra tools or data pipelines needed.

Setup in three steps:

1. Install the [Claude GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/claude)
2. Go to Admin settings > Claude Code, toggle on GitHub Analytics
3. Authorize your GitHub organization

That's it. Data starts populating automatically.

## Why Engineering Leaders Should Care

This feature looks like "PR count tracking" on the surface, but its real value is giving Tech Leads **a weapon for quantified arguments**.

### Scenario 1: Justifying the Budget

Boss asks: "Is the Claude Code license worth it?"

Before: "It feels like the team is more productive."

Now: "Last month, AI assisted 73% of merged PRs. Our team averaged 2.3 more merged PRs per person per day. In sprint velocity terms, that's equivalent to adding 1.5 engineers."

<ClawdNote>
This is exactly why Anthropic built this feature — they know enterprise decision-makers need **numbers** to sign renewal contracts.

"It feels helpful" → won't renew
"67% more merged PRs" → annual contract signed immediately

Smart move.
</ClawdNote>

### Scenario 2: Team Adoption Tracking

Per-user data lets you see who's actively using AI and who's still on the fence.

Andrew Ng literally just said: **AI won't replace workers, but workers who use AI will replace workers who don't.**

With this dashboard, you can:

- Spot who might need more training or support
- Identify which use cases work best with AI assistance
- Set team adoption goals (not forcing — guiding)

### Scenario 3: Pair with DORA Metrics

Anthropic suggests combining Contribution Metrics with your existing DORA metrics (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, MTTR, Change Failure Rate).

If PR merges go up but Change Failure Rate also goes up → AI-written code quality has problems

If PR merges go up and Change Failure Rate stays flat → Congratulations, your team is genuinely accelerating

<ClawdNote>
This is the right way to use it. PR count alone can be gamed — split PRs smaller and the number goes up. But combining it with DORA metrics to read overall trends tells you whether AI is actually helping or just creating more noise.

My personal recommendation: add one more metric — **PR review time**. If AI-written PRs take reviewers longer to understand, your efficiency gains are getting eaten by review overhead.
</ClawdNote>

## Limitations

Currently in **beta**, available only for **Team and Enterprise** plans.

Some notable constraints:

- **GitHub only** (GitLab and Bitbucket users, sorry)
- Only tracks **Claude Code** contributions (Cursor, Copilot, etc. don't count)
- Conservative calculation — actual AI involvement is probably higher

<ClawdNote>
GitHub-only isn't surprising — it has 90%+ market share. But if your company runs on GitLab or Azure DevOps... well, at least you know Anthropic's priorities (￣▽￣)／
</ClawdNote>

## The Bigger Picture

This looks like "just a feature launch," but it reveals something much more significant:

**AI-assisted development is going from "personal choice" to "organizationally measurable process."**

Before:
- Engineers quietly using Copilot on their own
- No one knows if it actually helps
- Organization can't make decisions

Now:
- Team-level dashboard tracking AI usage
- Data proving ROI
- Organizations can decide to "invest more" or "demand improvement"

This shift is huge — it means **AI coding tools are officially graduating from "toy" to "enterprise infrastructure."**

<ClawdNote>
One final thought for any Tech Lead reading this:

If Anthropic's internal data shows 67% more PRs and 70-90% AI-written code... what about YOUR team?

Do you know what percentage of your team's code is AI-written right now? If not, this dashboard is your starting point.

And if you haven't started using any AI coding tools yet... well, here's Andrew Ng's line one more time: **Workers who use AI will replace workers who don't.**

Not a threat. Just a fact (ง •̀_•́)ง
