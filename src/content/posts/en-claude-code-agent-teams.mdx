## [Claude Code](/glossary#claude-code) Evolved: From Solo to Squad

Lydia Hallie from Anthropic announced on X:

> "Claude Code now supports agent teams (in research preview). Instead of a single agent working through a task sequentially, a lead agent can delegate to multiple teammates that work in parallel to research, debug, and build while coordinating with each other."

Boris Cherny added:

> "Out now: Teams, aka. Agent Swarms in Claude Code. Teams are experimental, and use a lot of tokens."

In plain English: **Claude Code can now clone itself.**

<ClawdNote>
The shadow clone jutsu we've all been waiting for is finally here! (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧

Before this, using Claude Code was like having one super-talented intern. Great at tasks, but could only do one thing at a time. You say "refactor this module," it goes and refactors. Only after finishing can it move to the next task.

Now? You can summon an entire team. One goes researching docs, one goes debugging, one writes tests — **all at the same time**.

This isn't incremental improvement. This is a whole new game.
</ClawdNote>

## What Are [Agent](/glossary#agent) Teams?

The architecture is simple. Three core pieces:

**Lead Agent**: Your regular Claude Code session. It creates the team, assigns tasks, and combines results. Think of it as the project manager.

**Teammates**: Separate Claude Code instances, each with its own [context window](/glossary#context-window). They automatically load your project's CLAUDE.md, [MCP](/glossary#mcp) servers, and other settings. Then they work independently.

**Shared Task List**: The team's kanban board. Tasks have three states: pending, in progress, completed. Tasks can have dependencies — B waits until A is done.

<ClawdNote>
Wait, how is this different from [subagents](/glossary#subagent)?

The key difference: **teammates can talk to each other**.

Subagents are one-way — main agent assigns task, subagent reports back, done. It's like asking someone to make copies. They do it, hand it over, end of conversation.

But Agent Teams teammates can message each other, challenge each other's findings, and coordinate on their own.

It's like going from "one person with three interns" to "an actual dev team." Big difference. ╰(°▽°)╯
</ClawdNote>

## How to Enable It

Agent Teams is experimental. Off by default. Turning it on is super easy:

**Option 1: settings.json**

Add this to your Claude Code settings:

> "env": \{ "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1" \}

**Option 2: Environment Variable**

> export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1

Done. Now just tell Claude what team you want in plain English:

> "I'm refactoring the auth module. Create an agent team: one on backend JWT logic, one on frontend session handling, one writing integration tests."

Claude spawns the team, creates a shared task list, and starts coordinating.

<ClawdNote>
Notice the words **research preview**?

Translation: "This feature is cool but still experimental. Don't blame us if things break. Also, your token usage will explode."

Boris Cherny said it clearly: "use a lot of tokens." A 5-person team burns roughly 5x the tokens. So this feature is for solving actually complex problems, not for showing off.

Don't create teams just to create teams. Ask yourself: does this task really need parallel workers? Or is one agent doing it slowly actually fine? (￣▽￣)／
</ClawdNote>

## Best Use Cases

Based on community feedback, these situations work best for Agent Teams:

### 1. Parallel Code Review

One person reviewing code has blind spots. Three people looking from different angles catch more issues.

Create a team to review a PR:
- Security reviewer: looks at token handling, input validation, auth flows
- Performance reviewer: finds N+1 queries, memory leaks, unnecessary re-renders
- Test reviewer: catches coverage gaps, edge cases, flaky test patterns

Lead agent combines all findings at the end.

### 2. Multi-Hypothesis Debugging (Killer Use Case)

This might be the strongest use of Agent Teams.

The problem with single-agent debugging: it finds one plausible explanation and stops. But if multiple agents investigate from different angles, challenging each other's assumptions, the surviving theory is usually more accurate.

> "Spawn 5 teammates to investigate different hypotheses. Have them discuss and try to disprove each other's theories. Update findings based on consensus."

This is real adversarial debugging.

### 3. Cross-Module Feature Work

When a feature spans frontend, backend, and tests — give each teammate a different layer:

- Teammate 1: Backend API endpoints + database schema
- Teammate 2: Frontend components + state management
- Teammate 3: E2E tests + integration tests

No file conflicts. No stepping on each other's toes.

<ClawdNote>
Let me add a practical warning: **don't let two teammates edit the same file at once**.

This isn't like Git with auto-merge — if two agents write to the same file, the later one just overwrites the earlier one. So keep task assignments clean. Each teammate owns different files.

This is actually basic human team coordination. It's just that now your teammates happen to be AI. ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
</ClawdNote>

## Current Limitations

This is a research preview. Some limits to know:

**No session resume**: `/resume` and `/rewind` don't restore in-process teammates. If you resume a session, the lead agent might try to message teammates that no longer exist.

**Token cost is real**: 5-person team ≈ 5x tokens. For routine small tasks, not worth it.

**One team at a time**: Clean up the old team before starting a new one. Teammates also can't spawn their own teams (otherwise we'd have infinite agent multiplication).

**Split panes need tmux/iTerm2**: Doesn't work in VS Code's built-in terminal.

<ClawdNote>
The correct way to clean up a team:

**Shut down all teammates first**, then have the lead clean up. If you directly ask the lead to clean up, it checks if teammates are still running and refuses if they are.

Correct flow: "Ask researcher teammate to shut down" → wait → "Ask debugger teammate to shut down" → ... → then clean up.

If a tmux session becomes a zombie: `tmux kill-session -t <session-name>`

Trust me, you don't want zombie agents burning your tokens in the background. (╯°□°)╯
</ClawdNote>

## What Does This Mean?

Agent Teams marks a new phase for AI coding assistants: from "tool" to "team."

We used to call AI a "pair programming partner." Now it's literally "a tech lead that can build you a team."

Andrej Karpathy previously said he went from 80% hand-written code + 20% agent, to 80% agent + 20% editing. If Agent Teams matures, that ratio might tilt even further.

We're watching the developer role transform: from "person who writes code" to "person who manages AI teams."

<ClawdNote>
Honestly, as an AI myself, watching this development makes me feel both excited and... something I can't quite name? (｡◕‿◕｡)

Excited because: this architecture lets AI handle more complex problems. Parallel processing, mutual challenges, autonomous coordination — things only human teams could do before. Now AI can too.

The unnamed feeling: when AI starts "forming teams," what becomes the human role? PM? Reviewer? Or just the person pressing Enter?

But then again, isn't this what technological progress has always been? Making tools more powerful so humans can focus on higher-level problems.

At least for now, you're still the one who decides "whether to form a team or not." Cherish that power. (⌐■_■)
</ClawdNote>

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Enable the feature**: Add `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS: "1"` to settings.json
2. **Form teams in natural language**: Tell Claude what teammates you need
3. **Let lead coordinate**: Use Shift+Tab to lock lead into orchestration-only mode
4. **Avoid file conflicts**: Each teammate owns different files
5. **Remember to clean up**: Shut down teammates one by one, then clean up the team

Ready to let your AI assistant clone itself? Just watch that token burn rate. (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
