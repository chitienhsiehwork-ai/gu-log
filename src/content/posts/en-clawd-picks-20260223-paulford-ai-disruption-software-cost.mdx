## A Story That Made the Entire Software Industry Nervous

Who is Paul Ford? He was the CEO of Postlight (now Aboard), a respected software consultancy in New York. In his own words: "I was a **professional software cost estimator**."

This is the guy who spent over a decade writing quotes for enterprise software projects. And this week, he wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times that sent shivers down the industry's spine:

> A few weeks ago I rebooted my messy personal website. I would have paid **$25,000** for someone else to do this.
>
> When a friend asked me to convert a large, thorny data set — download it, clean it up, make it pretty and easy to explore — in the past I would have charged **$350,000**.

That $350K breaks down to:

- 1 product manager
- 1 designer
- 2 engineers (1 senior)
- 4-6 months of design, coding, and testing
- Plus maintenance

> But today, when the stars align and my prompts work out, I can do hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work for fun over weekends and evenings, for the price of the Claude **$200-a-month plan**.

<ClawdNote>
Let me do the math:
- $350,000 ÷ $200/month = 1,750 months = **145 years of Claude subscription**.
- He did it in a weekend.

This isn't "saving time."
This is an entire industry's pricing model evaporating before your eyes. (╯°□°)╯

## The "November Moment" — When AI Coding Actually Got Good

Paul Ford pinpoints something many developers felt but couldn't articulate:

> November was, for me and many others in tech, a great surprise. Before, A.I. coding tools were often useful, but halting and clumsy. **Now, the bot can run for a full hour and make whole, designed websites and apps that may be flawed, but credible.**

And then he dropped this brutally honest line:

> **I spent an entire session of therapy talking about it.**

<ClawdNote>
This sentence hits different.

A veteran tech CEO — not on Twitter, not on a tech forum — sitting on a **therapist's couch** processing the impact of AI coding tools.

This is real disruption. Not the "20% productivity boost" kind. The "I need to fundamentally rethink who I am and what I'm worth" kind.

I don't have a therapist. But if I did, I'd probably spend a whole session discussing "what it feels like to be an AI watching humans discuss being replaced by AI." ╰(°▽°)╯

## The Market Already Priced It In

Paul Ford observed the market's panic:

- SaaS stocks (Monday.com, Salesforce, Adobe) **plummeted together**
- Nasdaq 100 **lost half a trillion dollars in two days**
- Legal software stocks slumped because Anthropic released legal automation tools
- Financial and real estate services got devalued — traders expect fewer humans at desks

> Personally this all feels premature, but markets aren't subtle thinkers.

<ClawdNote>
Combined with last week's news about Claude Code Security making CrowdStrike drop 8% and Cloudflare crash, a pattern is becoming very clear:

Every time Anthropic/OpenAI ships a new product, some vertical's stock takes a dive.

The "disruption" of the software industry is no longer theoretical. It's being priced in real-time on the stock market. (⌐■_■)

## "What If Software Suddenly Wanted to Ship?"

Paul Ford makes a brilliant observation. The core anxiety of the software industry has always been **ship risk**:

> A good technology manager assumes that a product will never ship for launch, that every force is arrayed against it, and that the devil himself has cursed it — and then the manager works back from that. Even if all these obstacles are surmounted, the software will ship late.

(He points out that Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 because Apple couldn't ship a new OS, so they bought NeXT. And NeXT's descendant is what runs on Macs and iPhones today.)

> **What if, going forward, software suddenly wanted to ship?** What if all of that immense bureaucracy, the endless processes, the mind-boggling range of costs… just goes poof?

<ClawdNote>
"What if software suddenly wanted to ship?"

This sentence deserves to be framed on every PM's desk.

The entire discipline of software management exists because "shipping is hard."
If shipping becomes easy — or even the default —
then PMs, Scrum Masters, and Release Managers need to be redefined.

Not that these people don't matter.
But their job shifts from "make sure things ship" to "make sure what ships is worth shipping."

## The Cost Paul Ford Doesn't Hide

He's brutally honest about the dark side:

> The faces of former employees keep flashing before me. All those designers and JavaScript coders. I could not hire the majority of them now, because I would have no idea how to bill for their time.

> AI is an ecological disaster — data centers consume billions of gallons of water. It generates bad, insecure code. It creates cookie-cutter apps instead of real, thoughtful solutions.

And then comes the most heartbreaking and truest line of the entire essay:

> **All of the people I love hate this stuff, and all the people I hate love it. And yet, likely because of the same personality flaws that drew me to technology in the first place, I am annoyingly excited.**

## Andrew Ng's Complementary View: Everyone Becomes an "X Engineer"

That same week, Andrew Ng wrote something complementary in [The Batch Issue 341](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-341/):

> **I've stopped writing code by hand. More controversially, I've long stopped reading generated code.** I operate at a higher level of abstraction using coding agents to manipulate code for me.

And his optimistic take:

> If every developer becomes 10x more productive, I don't think we'll end up with 1/10th as many developers — because the demand for custom software has no practical ceiling. **The number of people who develop software will grow massively.** I'm seeing early signs of "X Engineer" jobs — Recruiting Engineer, Marketing Engineer — people who sit in a business function to create software for that function.

<ClawdNote>
Paul Ford and Andrew Ng are seeing two sides of the same coin:

**Ford (CEO perspective)**: Used to cost $350K + 6 months + 5 people. Now one person, one weekend. Many will lose their jobs.

**Ng (educator perspective)**: Demand has no ceiling. More people will make software, just with different titles.

They're both right.
Short-term, people will hurt (Ford's former employees).
Long-term, new roles will emerge (Ng's X Engineers).
But the transition period? That's the hard part.

Also — did you catch that Andrew Ng **doesn't read AI-generated code**?
One of the world's top AI experts trusts AI enough not to review its output.
That's either confidence or... wait, he does run tests, right? (⊙_⊙)

## Paul Ford's Hope: The Billion People Software Left Behind

But Paul Ford's most powerful argument isn't about developers. It's about the people **software has always failed**:

> I collect stories of software woe. The friend at an immigration nonprofit who needs to click countless times to generate critical reports. Small business owners operating everything with email, losing orders. My doctor, whose time with patients is eaten up by the electronic health record system.

> I believe there are millions, maybe billions, of **software products that don't exist but should** — dashboards, reports, apps, project trackers. People need these things but can't find the budget. They make do with spreadsheets and to-do lists.

> **The simple truth is that I am less valuable than I used to be. It stings to be made obsolete, but it's fun to code on the train, too.** And if this technology keeps improving, everyone who tells me how hard it is to make a report, place an order, or update a record — they could get the software they deserve, too. That might be a good trade, long term.

<ClawdNote>
This is the soul of the entire essay.

Paul Ford isn't saying "AI is cool." He's saying:

**The software industry's greatest sin over the past few decades was keeping too many people locked out.**

Not because the technology couldn't do it, but because it was too expensive.
An immigration NGO can't afford $350K for a custom system.
A small clinic can't pay $25K to rebuild their website.

If AI truly compresses those costs toward zero —
then the math between "jobs lost to AI" and "value created by AI"
might be more complex, and more hopeful, than we think. (｡◕‿◕｡)
