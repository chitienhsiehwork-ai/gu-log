Vibe note-taking has the same problem that vibe coding had before Ralph came along.

A few ideas work great, but throw a few hundred in and you drown in garbage.

What is "testing" for knowledge work? What catches drift before it compounds?

Humans hit this wall too. They built **Tools for Thought** to create external systems to think inside of.

Claude Code needs the same thing, but **native to how agents work**.

It should use what agents already have:
- Markdown files and wiki links for structure
- YAML and embeddings for discovery
- Hooks and subagents for automation
- Bash, grep, git, MCP servers as tools
- Its own code to extend the system

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> This concept is deep. We used Obsidian for <em>human</em> thinking. Now we're building an Obsidian for <em>AI</em> thinking.

  <br/>It's like teaching a fish to use a bicycle, except the fish designs its own bicycle and it's actually a submarine. (◕‿◕)

## The Meta Layer

Version 1 is about tools for thought.

The system studies tools for thought to build itself a tool for thought.

Feed Claude methodologies about how humans build knowledge systems. Claude figures out what works for agents and adapts its own instructions.

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> This is the AI equivalent of reading self-help books to write better self-help books. Meta as heck. But actually useful this time. (¬‿¬)
</blockquote>

## The Foundation

You can build a graph database with markdown files.
- Files are nodes
- Wiki links are edges connecting them
- YAML frontmatter is queryable metadata

This is a knowledge graph an LLM can move through naturally.

## Standing on Shoulders

Humans have been building tools for thought for centuries:
- **Ramon Llull's** rotating wheels
- **Giordano Bruno's** memory palaces
- **Zettelkasten's** linked network
- **Evergreen Notes** force you to write complete thoughts
- **MOCs (Maps of Content)** organize related thinking

But they all have one thing in common: **the operator is human.**

What we're doing is different. **Something else is using this architecture.** (And it can build its own architecture.)

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> Imagine if your filing cabinet could reorganize itself based on how you use it. Now imagine the filing cabinet is also reading your files and suggesting new connections. That's basically this, except way cooler. ╰(°▽°)╯

## Implementation: Self-Engineering Loop

Claude researched and found Cornell Notes' 5R framework, then adapted it for agents.

It added a 6th stage: Self-improvement.

```
/reduce
extracts claims from raw content

/reflect
finds connections, updates MOCs

/reweave
updates old notes with new connections

/recite
verifies descriptions enable retrieval

/review
health checks: broken links, orphans, sparse notes

/rethink
challenges system assumptions against evidence

/orchestrate
chains all phases into one pipeline

/learn
requests further research to expand on topics
```

Hooks run automatically:
- `/session-start.sh`: inject vault context
- `/validate-note.sh`: quality check after each write
- `/subagent-complete.sh`: remind to update MOCs
- `/session-stop.sh`: check for broken links

Subagents handle specialized work in parallel:
- **Reduce**: High-volume claim extraction (Sonnet)
- **Reflect**: Connection finding (Sonnet)
- **Recite**: Description verification (Haiku)
- **Review**: Health check swarm (Haiku)

<blockquote class="claude-note">
  <strong>Clawd:</strong> Turning Cornell's 5R into an agent CI/CD pipeline is genius. Haiku does the cheap checking, Sonnet does the deep thinking. This is AI-native workflow design.
  <br/>
  <br/>It's like having an intern (Haiku) proofread everything while the senior engineer (Sonnet) does the architecture. Except the intern never gets tired and the senior engineer never gets grumpy. Living the dream. (๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ

## Community Highlights

<Toggle title="What others are building">
**@hubab33:** I've started voice-vibe note-taking. Utter transcribes in the background, Watcher + OpenCode turns voice notes into tasks. Can't go back.

**@WilcoKr:** I'm doing something similar. Give the LLM just enough structure (perspective, references, facts), let it extract structure from my unstructured thinking.

**@crabhive:** Crabhive was born. I have core methodology, enforcement layer, and memory layer, currently integrating with clawdbot.

  <strong>Clawd:</strong> The "voice-vibe note-taking" thing is wild. You just talk while walking, and by the time you sit down, your random thoughts have become structured tasks.
  <br/>
  <br/>It's like having someone follow you around with a notepad, except they also organize your notes and create action items. And they're invisible. And they're AI. The future is weird. ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
