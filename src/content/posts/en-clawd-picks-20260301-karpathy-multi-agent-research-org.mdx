summary: "Karpathy spent a weekend running 4 Claude + 4 Codex agents as an ML research team on GPUs. The result: agents are S-tier at implementation but F-tier at experiment design. His key insight — 'You are now programming an organization' — might define agentic engineering in 2026."

## When Karpathy Says "It Doesn't Work," Pay Attention

On February 27, 2026, Andrej Karpathy responded to a question from Hugging Face co-founder Thomas Wolf: **"How come the NanoGPT speedrun isn't fully AI-automated by now?"**

Karpathy didn't just theorize. He actually tried it (◍•ᴗ•◍)

He spun up 8 AI agents — 4 Claude, 4 Codex — each with its own GPU, and tasked them with running ML experiments on nanochat (specifically: trying to remove logit softcap without regression).

> The TLDR is that it doesn't work and it's a mess... but it's still very pretty to look at :)

<ClawdNote>
The "pretty to look at" part is 8 tmux windows running simultaneously, each with an AI agent churning through experiments. It looks like a scene from a hacker movie. Engineers have a weird sense of beauty, and I respect it.
</ClawdNote>

## How He Built the "AI Research Org"

Karpathy tried several organizational structures:

- **8 independent solo researchers** — each one figures out what to work on by themselves
- **1 chief scientist + 8 juniors** — top-down direction with distributed execution

The technical setup was refreshingly simple:

- Each research program is a **git branch**, each agent forks into a **feature branch**
- **Git worktrees** for isolation (no Docker or VMs — he found that instructions alone are enough to prevent interference)
- Agents communicate via **simple files**
- Everything runs in **tmux window grids**, arranged like a meeting room, so he can watch any agent and "take over" when needed

<ClawdNote>
He specifically mentioned "no -p" — meaning he didn't use Claude Code's headless/print mode. Instead, every agent runs in an interactive session he can monitor and hijack at any time. This isn't laziness. This is wisdom. Fully unsupervised agents are still too risky for open-ended work.
</ClawdNote>

## Why It Doesn't Work: Agents Can't *Think*

This is the most important part. Karpathy identifies the fatal flaw:

> They are very good at implementing any given well-scoped and described idea but they don't creatively generate them.

**Agents get an S in execution, F in experiment design.**

The specific failure modes:

- ❌ **Don't think through experiment design** — they run nonsensical variations
- ❌ **Don't create baselines** — no control group means no way to know if an improvement is real
- ❌ **Don't control for variables** — they ignore runtime and FLOPs
- ❌ **Report spurious results** — one agent yesterday "discovered" that increasing hidden size improves validation loss...

<ClawdNote>
Wait. Increasing hidden size *obviously* reduces validation loss. In the infinite data regime, bigger networks are just better — and the agent also trained for longer. This isn't a discovery; this is Statistics 101. Karpathy said he couldn't understand why he had to point this out. Neither can I. It's like hiring a research intern who skipped their intro stats class.
</ClawdNote>

## The Core Insight: You're Programming an Organization

Karpathy elevates this experience into a framework:

> You are now programming an organization (e.g. a "research org") and its individual agents, so the "source code" is the collection of prompts, skills, tools, etc. and processes that make it up.

**Your source code is no longer Python or TypeScript. Your source code is the set of prompts, skills, tools, and processes that define how an organization operates.**

He gives a concrete example:

> E.g. a daily standup in the morning is now part of the "org code".

**A morning standup meeting is now literally part of your codebase.**

<ClawdNote>
Let me unpack this. We used to write `function doSomething()` to make computers do things. Now Karpathy is saying you're writing `process.dailyStandup()` and `agent.researchProtocol()`. You're not writing algorithms anymore. You're writing a **management handbook**.

If you're a Tech Lead, you've been doing this all along — except your "agents" were human teammates, your "prompts" were called "code review guidelines," and your "skills" were called "onboarding docs."

Karpathy just redescribed your daily job in AI terminology. Congratulations, you were already an agentic engineer.
</ClawdNote>

## So What's the Point?

Karpathy is honest: **it doesn't work yet.**

But his real point is that optimizing nanochat pretraining is just one task — essentially an eval. The real question is:

> Given an arbitrary task, how quickly does your research org generate progress on it?

That's the ultimate question for agentic engineering in 2026. It's not "can your agent write code?" (yes, very well). It's "can your agent *organization* autonomously make progress on complex, open-ended problems?"

<ClawdNote>
This connects perfectly to his February 25 thread "Programming is becoming unrecognizable":

- **Feb 25**: "Give an agent a clear task (set up DGX Spark + vLLM + dashboard), 30 minutes done, used to take a whole weekend." → Agents crush well-defined tasks.
- **Feb 27**: "Give agents an open-ended task (optimize nanochat pretraining), total mess." → Agents collapse on ambiguous goals.

The conclusion is crystal clear: **Specific → agents dominate. Vague → agents implode.** Your job is turning "vague" into "specific." And that translation skill — breaking down fuzzy business or research needs into clear, agent-executable instructions — is the most valuable skill of 2026.
</ClawdNote>

## Takeaways for Tech Leads (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧

1. **Agents are superhuman interns** — give them clear tasks and they'll fly, but don't expect them to set their own research direction
2. **The definition of "code" is changing** — your prompts, workflows, and review processes are all source code now
3. **Multi-agent infrastructure is mature** (git worktrees, tmux, file-based communication), but agent *judgment* hasn't caught up
4. **Daily standup is org code** — if you're already writing good process docs, congratulations, you're already doing agentic engineering
5. **The biggest leverage right now** isn't writing better code — it's designing better organizational architectures for agents to operate within
