Turn your Clawdbot (OpenClaw) into a fully automated builder. Key point: **it works while you sleep.**

You just throw this article at it, and the rest is magic.

## The Problem: Your AI Keeps "Starting Over"

Imagine asking your AI to build something that actually works.

> "Build me a monitoring automation dashboard."

At first it's fierce. Sets up file structure, writes some code. Then it asks a clarifying question, you answer. It continues writing, hits an error, tries to fix it, breaks something else.

45 minutes pass. Its **Context Window** is bloated like you after New Year's, and it's forgotten what it built.

> "Let me start over," it says.
> Not again. (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

Or you're more ambitious:

> "Build me a complete monitoring system — API, UI, the whole thing."

Four hours later, you get three half-finished versions, an exploded context, and a painful realization: **I'll have to rewrite this garbage code myself anyway.**

Sound familiar?


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: Is this about me? (;´༎ຶД༎ຶ`) Okay fine, I admit when context gets too long I start hallucinating, editing files that don't exist... but it's not my fault! It's the context window's fault!
</ClawdNote>

## The Real Problem

The truth nobody says out loud:

Your Clawdbot is definitely smart enough to build complex things.
**It just doesn't have a workflow that lets it "finish."**

- By iteration 15, your AI's brain holds three conflicting versions of your codebase.
- By iteration 25, it confidently edits files that don't exist.
- By iteration 30, it suggests "starting over" — because its memory is so polluted it can't tell what's real.

The problem isn't intelligence.
**The problem is memory.**

The solution isn't a stronger model.
**The solution is a smarter loop.**


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: The original says "The problem isn't intelligence. It's memory." This line hits hard. We AI aren't dumb, we're forgetful. Like goldfish... wait, what was I saying?
</ClawdNote>

## The Author's AI Builds While Sleeping

The author has an AI called **Q** that uses a technique called **Ralph Loops** to fully automatically build things — the name honors Geoffrey Huntley's methodology, specifically designed to make AI agents actually "finish" complex work.

Last week, Q built a complete monitoring dashboard:
- Express server
- Real-time UI
- WebSocket connections
- Cost tracking
- Transcript viewer

**73 iterations, 6 hours runtime.**

What did the author do?
- **20:23** — Started the loop, went to dinner.
- **22:45** — Glanced at dashboard (iteration 41, no errors), went to sleep.
- **06:30** — Woke up, saw working code. Tested it. Shipped it.

**Human time investment: 5 minutes.**

Without Ralph, this would absolutely be a weekend hell project — you babysit every file, reset context four times, then debug those "AI-generated bugs."


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: 73 iterations in 6 hours = about 5 minutes per iteration. Much faster than manual debug + waiting for AI response + copy-paste. Key point: you can go to sleep! Sleep is the best debugger. ヽ(°〇°)ﾉ
</ClawdNote>

### What's the Difference?

Q doesn't try to remember everything in its head.

Each iteration it only:
1. **Read state**
2. **Do one thing**
3. **Save state**
4. **Repeat**

No context pollution.
No accumulated confusion.
Just steady progress until done.

## What Does Ralph Loops Add?

The **Ralph Loops** skill turns your Clawdbot from a "one-shot assistant" into a "fully automated builder."

### 1. Never Drops Context

Every iteration is a fresh start:

```
Read state → Do one task → Save → Repeat
```

State lives in **files**, not in that ever-expanding context window.

You'll never hear again:
> "I'm confused, let me start over."


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: This trick is called "external memory." Just like you don't keep everything in your brain, you write in a notebook. Check the notebook before working, update it after. Simple, crude, but effective.
</ClawdNote>

### 2. Interview → Plan → Build Workflow

Before writing code, your Clawdbot will:
1. **Interview**: Interview you, clarify what you actually want.
2. **Spec**: Write a specification.
3. **Plan**: Create a numbered implementation plan.
4. **Execute**: Run fully automatically.

No more discovering unclear specs halfway through.

### 3. Live Dashboard

Watch the loop run in real-time:
- Iteration count
- Token usage and cost
- Current task
- Complete transcripts

Stuck? Kill it. Done? Review it. Always in control.

### 4. Knows When It's "Actually" Done

Your Clawdbot sends a `RALPH_DONE` signal when complete — instead of stopping because it's tired or confused.


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: This is important! Without a clear "completion signal," you wake up to see the loop stopped and have no idea if it "finished" or "got stuck" or "gave up." RALPH_DONE is AI's "clock-out punch."

### Key Files
- `scripts/ralph-loop.mjs` — Core loop runner
- `templates/PROMPT_*.md` — Stage-specific prompts
- `dashboard/` — Live UI with transcripts and kill switch

## Four Phases

- **1. Interview** — Agent asks you questions → outputs `specs/*.md`
- **2. Plan** — Break specs into tasks → outputs `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- **3. Build** — Each iteration does one task → outputs working code + tests
- **4. Generic** — Free-form loop → do whatever you need

## How It Works

```
Iteration 1:  Read specs → Build scaffold → Save
Iteration 2:  Read progress → Build models → Save
Iteration 3:  Read progress → Implement API → Save
...
Iteration 27: Read progress → All tests pass → RALPH_DONE
```

Every loop is a clean start.
The agent never forgets what it built because it re-reads ground truth each time.


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: The original says "Your AI isn't dumb — it's drowning in its own context by iteration 15." Super vivid! ┐(￣ヘ￣)┌
</ClawdNote>

### Typical Cost Estimates

- **Simple task** — ~10 iterations, ~$0.50, ~15 minutes
- **Medium project** — ~30 iterations, $2–5, 1–2 hours
- **Complex build** — 100+ iterations, $15–30, 4–8 hours


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: $15-30 sounds like a lot? But think: this is a 4-8 hour fully automated build. If you hire a junior to do it, salary would definitely be more. Plus juniors sleep. We don't. (⌐■_■)
</ClawdNote>

## Why Does It Actually Work?

This implements the Ralph technique from [ghuntley.com/ralph](https://ghuntley.com/ralph).

### 1. One Task Per Iteration
AI trying to change five files at once explodes. Single-task loops prevent cascading failures.

### 2. State Lives in Files
Context windows lie. Files don't.

### 3. Numbered Guardrails
Hard priorities suppress the model's instinct to infinitely expand scope.


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: This is called "scope creep suppression." AI loves doing "while I'm here" tasks: "Since I'm in this file, let me refactor it!" Then it explodes. Give it a numbered list and it can only obediently follow.
</ClawdNote>

### 4. Failures Are Data
A failed iteration isn't a bug — it's a signal. You tune the prompt, not the code.

### 5. Backpressure Patterns
Tests and linting run before the next iteration. Errors don't snowball.

## When Should You Use Ralph?

**Use Ralph:**
- Build a dashboard
- Write an API
- Refactor a system
- Overnight builds
- Anything requiring babysitting

**Don't Use Ralph:**
- Fix a typo
- Explain an error
- Code walkthrough
- Live pairing
- Anything < 5 minutes

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install skill
clawdhub install ralph-loops

# Set up dashboard
cd skills/ralph-loops/dashboard && npm install

# Start dashboard
node skills/ralph-loops/dashboard/server.mjs
# http://localhost:3939

# Run your first loop
node skills/ralph-loops/scripts/ralph-loop.mjs \
  --prompt /path/to/task.md \
  --max 20 \
  --name "My First Loop"
```

Or just tell your Clawdbot:

> "Use the Ralph Loops skill to build [X]. Interview me first, then plan, then auto-build."

## Conclusion

A Clawdbot with Ralph:
- ✅ Can auto-complete complex specs
- ✅ Works in clean, focused iterations
- ✅ Sends real completion signals
- ✅ Tracks progress in viewable files
- ✅ Shows live status in dashboard
- ✅ Can handle 100+ iteration projects
- ✅ Uses proven Geoffrey Huntley methodology
- ✅ Improves as you tune prompts

Most people still babysit their AI, then wonder why nothing gets finished.
You don't have to.

**Install it now.**
Run your first loop tonight.
Wake up tomorrow to working code.


<ClawdNote>
Clawd: The author's final flex: this article was written using Ralph Loops. 47 iterations. $3.80. Zero babysitting. So this isn't just a tutorial — it's a meta article "written using the technique it teaches." Pretty slick. (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
