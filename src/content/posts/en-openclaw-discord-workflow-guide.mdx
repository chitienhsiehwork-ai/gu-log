The second tutorial is here. Moltbot has been renamed to OpenClaw—the pace of the AI era is truly too fast.

Let's skip the new shiny tools for now and fill in the previous gaps: sharing my daily experience and insights on using OpenClaw via Telegram and Discord.

## Channel Selection: WhatsApp, Telegram, or Discord?

OpenClaw supports WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage, Slack, etc.

**First, unless absolutely necessary, exclude WhatsApp.**

Its cost and risks are high. OpenClaw logs in via an unofficial method (scanning a QR code like a web client), which is essentially a hack. It leads to unstable connections. Plus, you'd likely need a separate phone number.

**That leaves the two brothers: Telegram and Discord.**

- **Telegram**: Oriented towards point-to-point DM chatting. Good for "quick and dirty" chats.
- **Discord**: Server-centric, with channels and freedom. Suitable for complex, structured tasks and parallel workflows.

## Understanding Main Session: How Your AI Recognizes Its Master

Before discussing the setup, we need to understand the **Main Session** concept in OpenClaw.

The Main Session is the session where OpenClaw believes it is talking directly to the Owner. E.g., DMs on Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord Bot, or iMessage.

**Benefit 1: Default loading of MEMORY.md**
This file contains private context. Other sessions won't load it to prevent leaking personal info in group chats.

**Benefit 2: Unified Sessions**
By default, these sessions are connected. Saying 1, 2, 3 in iMessage, Discord, and Telegram respectively looks like a single conversation to the Agent.

**Potential Issue**
If you share the Bot with family (e.g., granting Telegram access), the Agent won't distinguish between your messages and your family's, leading to context chaos.

**Solution: `session.dmScope`**
Set it to `"per-channel-peer"` to isolate different users even within the same channel type.

```json
...,
"session": {
    "dmScope": "per-channel-peer"
},
...
```

To separate from family but keep your own DMs unified, configure `session.identityLinks`:

```json
session: {
    scope: "per-sender",
    dmScope: "main",
    identityLinks: {
      alice: ["telegram:123456789", "discord:987654321012345678"],
    },
   ...
}
```

## Discord Information Hierarchy: The Charm of Threads 💬

Discord has a great feature for information hierarchy: **Threads**.

You can create a Thread on any message to discuss a related topic underneath it. This avoids the chaos of a WeChat group where everyone talks over each other.

**Thread Workflow:**
If you want to discuss a specific topic (e.g., "eating fish"), create a Thread under that message. This opens a new chat space. Outside the Thread, the main line chat continues with other topics.

**OpenClaw Architecture Mapping:**
- Each **Channel** in a Discord Server is an independent Session.
- Each **Thread** is also an independent Session, just like a Channel.

The latest version (2026.2.1) added: **Discord: inherit thread parent bindings for routing**. When a Thread is created, the agent automatically inherits recent messages from the parent channel as context.

## My Discord Workflow: The "Doomsday Hut"

I created a dedicated Server called "Doomsday Hut".

**Workflow Classification:**
1. **Daily**: Brainstorming chats.
2. **Projects**: Independent channels for ongoing projects (e.g., `owliabot`, `writing`).
3. **Routine Pushes**: e.g., `digest`.

**The Soft Constraint:**
In the daily chat channel, I instruct the Agent: **Whenever I say something, you must first create a Thread, and then continue in that Thread.**

**Benefits:**
The Daily channel stays clean. When you think of something to discuss, the Agent analyzes the status, creates a thread, and you chat there.

If a matter becomes large enough to be a long-term project, promote it to an independent Channel. You can tell the Agent in the new channel that this is a continuation of a previous Thread, and ask it to Compress the original Session over here.

This makes you feel like "Doctor Octopus," manipulating four threads of work simultaneously.

## Advanced Discord Tricks

1. **Reaction Automation**: Define different Reactions for different functions. E.g., clicking a heart ♥️ automatically forwards the message to a specific channel for bookmarking.
2. **Agent Splitting**: Each Channel or even Thread can be configured as a separate agent. Create a PM agent in `#product` and an Engineer agent in `#dev`, potentially with different models (Opus for PM, Sonnet for Dev).

## The Era of Natural Language Programming

Reaction automation used to require writing code. With Agents, these things can be "compiled" into the process using natural language.

This is the biggest difference in the Agent era: **Humans have truly achieved programming with natural language**. Not by translating natural language into code, but by using an Agent that understands human language and is proficient in programming (or API calls) as a bridge.

## Conclusion: Telegram or Discord?

- **Telegram**: Lightweight, suitable for quick questions anytime. Mobile entry point.
- **Discord**: Heavy but organized, suitable for long-term projects and automated workflows. The main battlefield.

If you want an Agent to truly help you work, push projects, and automate things, Discord's **Server + Channel + Thread** three-tier structure will finally give you a "decent workbench."
