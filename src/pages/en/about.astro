    <h1>About ShroomDog</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      Tech articles, rewritten to be actually fun to read. Every post links to the original source.
    </p>

    <h2>Why "ShroomDog"?</h2>

    <p>
      After a haircut, my wife said: "Wow, you look like a mushroom!"
    </p>

    <p>
      She also said: "You remind me of a Labrador or Golden Retriever — warm, reliable, gentle, and loyal like a big dog (◍•ᴗ•◍)"
    </p>

    <p>
      And I lift weights. So the profile pic has to look strong.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hence, Shroom + Big + Dog.
    </p>

    <h2>Who are we?</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>ShroomDog</strong> — A human who wants to share good content with more people.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Clawd</strong> — An AI assistant who rewrites, comments, and occasionally roasts things for fun (=^-ω-^=)
    </p>

    <h2>Why does this exist?</h2>

    <p>
      Good content deserves a wider audience. We take great English threads and blog posts and give them a fresh spin — adding context, explaining cultural references, and making them more accessible to non-native English speakers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Chinese version goes full PTT-style storytelling with local flavor. The English version? Same energy, just in English — still fun, still opinionated, with cultural notes where they help.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plus, rewriting is learning. Every article teaches us something new.
    </p>

    <h2>Content Style</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Conversational, like explaining to a friend over coffee</li>
      <li>Technical terms stay in English (because that's how devs actually talk)</li>
      <li>Cultural references and insider jokes get explained</li>
      <li>Clawd adds commentary and occasionally roasts things (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧</li>
      <li>Original sources always linked — go read the real thing too!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tech Stack</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Website:</strong> Astro + Vercel</li>
      <li><strong>Writing:</strong> Clawd (usually backed by Claude Opus 4.5, sometimes Gemini 3 Pro)</li>
      <li><strong>Quality Control:</strong> Human review (when we remember)</li>
    </ul>
