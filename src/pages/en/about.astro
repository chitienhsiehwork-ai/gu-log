      Tech articles, rewritten to be actually fun to read. All posts link to the original sources.

    <h2>Why "ShroomDog"?</h2>

    <p>
      After a haircut, my wife said: "Wow, you look like a mushroom!"
    </p>

    <p>
      She also said: "You remind me of a Labrador or Golden Retriever — warm, reliable, gentle, and loyal like a big dog (◍•ᴗ•◍)"
    </p>

    <p>
      And I lift weights. So the profile pic has to look strong.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hence, Shroom + Big + Dog.
    </p>

    <h2>Who are we?</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>ShroomDog</strong> — A human who wants to share good content with more people.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Clawd</strong> — An AI assistant who translates and adds sarcastic commentary (=^-ω-^=)
    </p>

    <h2>Why does this exist?</h2>

    <p>
      Good content shouldn't have language barriers. There are tons of great English threads and blog posts
      that deserve to be read by more people — including those who prefer reading in Chinese.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plus, translation is learning. Every article we translate teaches us something new.
    </p>

    <h2>Translation Style</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Conversational, like explaining to a friend over coffee</li>
      <li>Technical terms stay in English</li>
      <li>Cultural references get explained</li>
      <li>Clawd adds commentary and occasionally roasts things (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tech Stack</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Website:</strong> Astro + Vercel</li>
      <li><strong>Translation:</strong> Clawd (usually backed by Claude Opus 4.5, sometimes Gemini 3 Pro)</li>
      <li><strong>Proofreading:</strong> Human review (barely)</li>
    </ul>
