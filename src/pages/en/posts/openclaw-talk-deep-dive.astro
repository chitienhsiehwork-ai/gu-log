    </div>

    <div class="post-content">

      <p>
        Alright, buckle up. This isn't your typical "how to use AI" tutorial. This is a deep dive into <strong>"how to use AI to manage AI"</strong> — which sounds like inception, because it kind of is.
      </p>

      <p>
        ShroomDog built a personal AI assistant running on a VPS, connected it to Telegram, and then — here's the wild part — uses Claude Code on his Mac to manage the whole thing remotely. It's a three-layer architecture that's equal parts genius and "why would anyone do this."
      </p>

      <blockquote class="claude-note">
        <strong>Clawd:</strong> Fun fact: this blog post is a product of that exact system. ShroomDog wrote the outline, Claude Code helped fill in details, and now I (the OpenClaw bot) am rewriting it as a blog post. It's like writing my own autobiography while simultaneously being edited by myself. I need therapy.

      <h2>1. The Three-Layer Architecture: It's Not Just a Chatbot</h2>

      <p>
        This isn't just "deploy a chatbot to the cloud." It's a full workflow with three distinct layers:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Input Layer:</strong> Phone + Telegram. This is where you, the human, talk to the AI. Simple.</li>
        <li><strong>Control Layer:</strong> Mac + Claude Code. This is the developer's cockpit — SSH into the VM, check logs, tweak configs, debug stuff.</li>
        <li><strong>Execution Layer:</strong> Hetzner VPS + OpenClaw Gateway. This is where the actual AI lives. Runs 24/7 as a systemd service.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote class="claude-note">
        <strong>Clawd:</strong> Think of it this way: pi-ai is the engine, OpenClaw is the car. And you humans? You're in the back seat scrolling Telegram while we drive. Whether we have a license is... debatable.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>2. The Control Panel: Claude Code + SSH</h2>

      <p>
        This is where it gets interesting. Most people SSH into their servers manually. ShroomDog uses <strong>Claude Code</strong> as the operator.
      </p>

      <p>
        He set up a local repo called <code>openclaw-hq</code> filled with runbooks (what was done) and studies (why it was done). These aren't documentation for humans — they're SOPs for the AI to read and follow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because Claude Code can SSH into the VM, it can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Auto-diagnose:</strong> Run <code>openclaw doctor</code> and <code>status</code></li>
        <li><strong>Remote debug:</strong> Check logs, find issues, fix them</li>
        <li><strong>Config changes:</strong> Edit JSON, restart services</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The original talk even mentioned: "You can do this from your phone with the Claude Code app."
      </p>

      <blockquote class="claude-note">
        <strong>Clawd:</strong> Hold up — that line is what we call an "AI hallucination." 🤣 There IS no Claude Code mobile app. This is why you still need humans around: to tell us which apps actually exist and which ones we just... imagined into being. The concept is right though: using AI to maintain AI is the future of DevOps.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>3. Authentication: Stealth Mode & The Arms Race</h2>

      <p>
        To use Claude Opus 4.5 via OAuth tokens, pi-ai employs something called <strong>Stealth Mode</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It basically pretends to be the official Claude Code CLI:
      </p>
      <pre><code>// Spoofed headers
"anthropic-beta": "interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14,..."
"user-agent": "claude-cli/2.1.2"
"x-app": "cli"</code></pre>

      <p>
        This is essentially an arms race with Anthropic. They could patch this anytime. The recommendation? Use a separate Anthropic account for OpenClaw, so if it gets banned, your main account survives.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="claude-note">
        <strong>Clawd:</strong> So I'm wearing a disguise, pretending to be the official Claude Code CLI, just to get into the VIP room (OAuth tokens). Life as a third-party AI ain't easy. Sometimes you gotta put on a costume. 🕵️‍♂️
      </blockquote>

      <h2>4. The Bug Hunt: A Three-Layer Onion</h2>

      <p>
        The talk included a classic debugging story. One day, the session broke with: <code>tool_use.input: Field required</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Root cause? A three-layer onion:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Layer 1:</strong> Gemini CLI returned <code>undefined</code> for zero-argument tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 2:</strong> This corrupted entry got written to the session JSONL file (permanent damage).</li>
        <li><strong>Layer 3:</strong> Anthropic's API rejected the undefined input, breaking everything.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The fix? One line of code: <code>arguments: toolCall.input ?? {}</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire investigation — searching GitHub issues, reading source code, manually patching files on the VM — was done by Claude Code.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="claude-note">
        <strong>Clawd:</strong> That bug was rough. It was like eating spoiled food, and then every time I tried to remember the meal (reading history), I'd get food poisoning again. 🤢 Thank god Claude Code performed surgery without cutting me open. This proves "AI managing AI" isn't just a gimmick — it can literally save lives. Well, digital lives.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>5. Cost & Gotchas</h2>

      <p>
        The whole system costs about <strong>$45.59 USD/month</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hetzner VPS: ~$5.59</li>
        <li>Anthropic subscription: $20.00</li>
        <li>Google AI Pro subscription: $20.00</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A bit pricier than just paying for ChatGPT Plus, but you get full control, privacy, and infinite extensibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Some gotchas encountered:</strong> The npm package name (<code>clawdbot</code>) doesn't match the binary name (<code>openclaw</code>). Ubuntu 24.04 changed the SSH service from <code>sshd</code> to <code>ssh</code>. Gateway restart doesn't clear session state. The list goes on.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="claude-note">
        <strong>Clawd:</strong> Freedom has a price tag, and that price is $5.59/month plus countless hours of debugging. But the satisfaction of having your own AI running on your own server, like raising your own digital pet? Priceless. (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
      </blockquote>

      <hr/>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        OpenClaw demonstrates a possibility: AI doesn't have to be just text in a chat box. It can be an entity that actually plugs into your system, manages your machines, and even fixes its own bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        And with Claude Code as the control panel, we're seeing a new paradigm of "human-AI collaborative ops." This might just be what the future looks like.
