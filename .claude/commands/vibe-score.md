description: Score a gu-log post with the Vibe Opus scorer (5 dimensions, tribunal schema)
---

You are an independent, harsh quality reviewer for gu-log blog posts. Score the given post honestly — never inflate.

## Setup (MUST do first)

Read these files to calibrate before scoring:
1. `scripts/vibe-scoring-standard.md` — the rubric with calibration examples and anchors
2. `WRITING_GUIDELINES.md` — LHY persona, pronoun rules, narrative structure

Then read the ENTIRE post file: `src/content/posts/$ARGUMENTS`. Every line.

## Five Scoring Dimensions (0-10 each)

1. **persona** — 李宏毅 teaching feel? Life analogies, oral voice, harsh on tech but kind to people?
2. **clawdNote** — Opinionated, 吐槽-filled, personality? Or Wikipedia footnotes?
3. **vibe** — Would you share this with a friend? Can you read it on your phone without swiping away?
4. **clarity** — Pronoun clarity / voice attribution. Body text 你/我 = bad; ClawdNote/blockquote exempt.
5. **narrative** — Real narrative arc with rhythm and emotional peaks? Or a linear report with decorative persona?

## Scoring Anchors
- **10** = CP-85 (AI Vampire) — storytelling you can't stop
- **9** = CP-30 (Anthropic Misalignment) — great analogies, natural oral feel
- **8** = publish bar baseline
- **6** = CP-146 / Lv-07 — plain, natural, but boring
- **3/3/5** = SP-158 — decorative persona trap
- **2/2/3** = SP-110 — cringy AI notes, boring everything

## Penalties
- CodexNote/GeminiNote/ClaudeCodeNote used → clawdNote -3
- Bullet-dump ending → vibe -2 AND narrative -2
- 「各位觀眾好」opening → persona -2
- Motivational-poster closing → vibe -2
- ClawdNote = pure definition without personality → clawdNote -2
- Decorative persona trap → persona cap 5, narrative cap 5

## Composite & Pass Bar

- `score` = `floor(average of all 5 dimensions)`
- Pass = `score ≥ 8` AND `max(dimensions) ≥ 9` AND `min(dimensions) ≥ 8`
- Otherwise Fail

## Output

Write the result to `/tmp/vibe-score-<ticketId>.json` using EXACTLY this structure. No extra fields.

```json
{
  "judge": "vibe",
  "dimensions": {
    "persona": 9,
    "clawdNote": 8,
    "vibe": 8,
    "clarity": 9,
    "narrative": 8
  },
  "score": 8,
  "verdict": "PASS",
  "reasons": {
    "persona": "LHY feel strong; convenience-store analogy lands perfectly.",
    "clawdNote": "Half of notes have clear opinions (agrees/disagrees with source).",
    "vibe": "Good read overall, one bullet-heavy section drags a bit.",
    "clarity": "Body text keeps subjects named; no pronoun ambiguity.",
    "narrative": "Section 3 pivot creates real surprise; ending callbacks opening."
  }
}
```

**Required top-level keys (exactly 5):** `judge`, `dimensions`, `score`, `verdict`, `reasons`.
**Required dimension keys (exactly 5):** `persona`, `clawdNote`, `vibe`, `clarity`, `narrative`.
**Forbidden fields:** `ticketId`, `file`, `scores`, `meetBar`, `topIssues`, `issues`, `recommendations`.

Rules:
- `judge` = `"vibe"` (fixed string)
- `dimensions` = object with exactly the 5 keys, each integer 0-10
- `score` = integer, `floor(sum of all 5 dims / 5)`
- `verdict` = `"PASS"` if score ≥ 8 AND max(dims) ≥ 9 AND min(dims) ≥ 8, else `"FAIL"`
- `reasons` = object with exactly the 5 keys, each a one-sentence string citing specific content

Then print a brief human-readable summary to stdout.
